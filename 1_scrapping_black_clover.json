["In Hage, a priest finds two babies abandoned outside his church. He takes them inside and discovers their names to be Yuno and Asta.\nFifteen years later, Asta proposes to Sister Lily, who refuses repeatedly. Yuno and the other orphans criticize Asta and point out his lack of magic. Asta tries to show off his skills, but Yuno outshines him with his magic.\nLater, at the Grimoire Acceptance Ceremony, a pair of nobles criticize the commoners there. Despite Asta not receiving a grimoire while Yuno attains a four-leaf clover one, Asta challenges Yuno to the title of Magic Emperor, but Yuno ignores him.\nAfter the ceremony, the two nobles ambush Yuno outside the tower, but Yuno overpowers them. All three are then ambushed by Revchi Salik, a former Magic Knight who plans to steal Yuno's grimoire and sell it. Asta comes to Yuno's rescue but fails.\nAs Revchi breaks Asta's spirit, Yuno calls Asta his rival. Motivated by this acknowledgment, Asta decides to keep fighting, which summons a grimoire from the tower. Revchi notices that it has a five-leaf clover, and when a large sword appears from the grimoire, Asta grabs it and the shadow of a devil appears behind him.\n", "Ten years prior, Yuno was running through a trail and suddenly fell down. Asta asked Yuno if he was okay and came close to him, so Yuno could grab his hand and get up. Asta called Yuno a crybaby and told him it is okay since he got his back. Then, Asta and Yuno kept running along the trail, holding hands, and Asta commented that Sister Lily and the other orphans were waiting for them at the top. Asta started making a tantrum because he wanted to marry Lily. Yuno explained him that was not possible since Lily was a member of the cloth. Asta told Yuno that he was not finished yet and that he would definitely marry her one day as an adult, at which Lily smiled.\nLater in the church, Lily read to Yuno and Asta a story about how the Magic Emperor came to exist. After a demon had brought darkness and threatened to destroy the world, a brave mage fought and defeated the demon, returning dawn to the world. While doing so, Yuno appeared frightened and Asta was really into the story. The story ended and Yuno and Asta seemed very inspired.\nOne day, Asta was admiring the view of the Magic Emperor's statue on top of the giant skull outside the church. Asta asked Lily if the Magic Emperor was an important person, to which the sister agreed and added that he was the most important person after the King. Asta stood on top of the fence outside the orphanage and told them that he had made up his mind: He would become the Magic Emperor. Lily seemed very surprised and Asta proceeded to list why he wanted to be the Magic Emperor. After that, Asta asked Lily if she would marry him since he was going to be the Magic Emperor, to which Lily responded that it was a completely different subject. Asta kept asking and the sister kept saying no. Yuno released a giggle about this.\nOn December 12, Asta was practicing his magic with no results. He seemed to be frustrated over why he could not use his magic yet. Lily passed by carrying a laundry basket and Asta told her that he would help her with the laundry, for which Lily thanked him. He then told her to marry him and she immediately answered, \"No.\" He tried to ask her again but she kept interrupting him and refusing. Yuno came by trying to stop baby Nash crying, and Asta told Yuno to not start crying, too. Asta said that because he was going to become the Magic Emperor, there was no difficulty in stopping one baby's cry or two. When Asta grabbed Nash, he started to shake the baby in a rough way, causing Nash to cry even more. Lily was able to stop Nash crying and Asta seemed quite surprised. Recca mocked Asta because he declared himself to be the Magic Emperor in a future. Father Orsi asked the orphans to deliver a letter to another town. Asta volunteered but Orsi chose Yuno instead. Asta told Yuno that he would go, but Yuno refused and grabbed the letter and left.\nIn the town, Yuno delivered the letter and then was accosted by a drunkard, who took the boy's necklace. Asta noted that Yuno was running late. Yuno attempted to fight back with his Wind Magic, but the drunkard mocked him and his weak magic. Suddenly Asta ran in and tried to tackle the man, who knocked Asta aside. However, each time he was hit, Asta kept getting up and demanding the necklace. Seeing the bloodied and bruised boy's determination, the man eventually gave up and dropped the necklace. Yuno apologized for getting Asta hurt, but Asta reminded him that he would always have Yuno's back.\nBack in the present, Revchi Salik freaks out about the grimoire and sword that appeared, while a devil-shaped shadow appears on the wall behind Asta. A swing from the sword nullifies Revchi's Chain Magic. As he slams the sword into Revchi, Asta declares that he will become the Magic Emperor despite not having magic and that not giving up is his magic. Revchi is knocked unconscious and sent crashing into a wall. Asta explains that he trained his body physically since he did not have magic. Asta and Yuno recall the promise they made to each other and reaffirm their vow to become the Magic Emperor.\n", "A city is being attacked by a giant demon. The First Magic Emperor then appears and defeats the demon.\nOver the following generations, the Clover Kingdom is protected by a Magic Emperor, who commands nine squads of Magic Knights. The duty of all is to protect the kingdom, as well as the citizens, with their own lives.\nAsta finishes his thousand swings with the sword he got from his grimoire and proceeds to drink moguro leaf juice. Yuno has been training too, chopping wood and shattering rocks. Both of them want to apply to the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.\nSister Lily and Father Orsi visit Drouot to discuss their foster sons taking the exam. Afterward, Asta and Yuno race each other back to the church, and Nash claims Yuno won.\nThe next day while Asta is training, Nash approaches him and says that orphans are too weak and poor to dream of becoming Magic Knights. However, Asta yells at him not to give up, declaring that he will prove anyone can. That night, Lily and Orsi prepare a special dinner of various tato dishes for the boys before they leave in the morning.\nThe boys depart and Lily remembers first meeting the boys and the night Yuno brought back an injured Asta. During their long journey to the Royal Capital, the boys continue training.\n", "The boys arrive in Kikka and register for the Magic Knights Entrance Exam. While all the candidates are waiting, they are approached by the anti-birds, which flock towards those with less magic power, so they stay away from Yuno and swarm Asta. Trying to get away from the birds, Asta runs into Yami Sukehiro, captain of the Black Bulls, and his companions Finral Roulacase and Gordon Agrippa.\nAfter Yami leaves, Sekke Bronzazza introduces himself to Asta and describes the captains and their squads as they enter: Nozel Silva of the Silver Eagles, Fuegoleon Vermillion of the Crimson Lions, Jack the Ripper of the Green Mantises, Charlotte Roselei of the Blue Roses, Gueldre Poizot of the Purple Orca, Dorothy Unsworth of the Coral Peacocks, Rill Boismortier of the Aqua Deer, and William Vangeance of the Golden Dawns.\nDuring the exam, Asta struggles with various tests while Yuno and Sekke display great skill. For the final test, the candidates find partners to fight. Sekke chooses Asta because he sees Asta as a weak peasant. However, Asta defeats Sekke with a single swing and announces that he is aiming to become the Magic Emperor.\n", "After Asta defeats Sekke Bronzazza and announces his intention to become the Magic Emperor, the crowd thinks that Asta is being delusional. Other contestants face off and Yuno gets paired off with Salim Hapshass. Salim casts his most powerful spell, but Yuno is able to defeat him easily with his Towering Tornado.\nThe exam ends and the squad captains pick from the contestants. Yuno is wanted by all the captains and decides to join the Golden Dawn squad. Asta receives no offers. Yami Sukehiro tells Asta that it is because they do not know the source of his power and he does not have any magical powers. Asta tells him that no matter how many times he fails he is going to continue pursuing becoming the Magic Emperor. Yami invites him to join his squad, the Black Bull, and Asta accepts.\nYuno and Asta begin to talk but Asta then has to go use the restroom. Sekke follows Asta into the restroom. He creates a poisonous lizard to go in after Asta but Yuno stops him. Asta is taken to Black Bull's Base. He opens the door to go inside but is blasted with fire. Yami welcomes him to the squad.\n", "Yuno is introduced to Klaus Lunettes at Golden Dawn's base. Klaus warns him that he will not be accepted into the group so easily.\nAsta tries to introduce himself to the Black Bulls but they are too busy with their own problems. Yami Sukehiro finally gets their attention by destroying a wall and they all come rushing out to meet him. Yami introduces them to Asta and one by one they introduce themselves. Asta wants a robe but is told he has to convince Magna Swing first. Magna puts him through an initiation ritual by making him do push ups and sit ups. For the final trial, he has to block an attack from Magna. If he does this then he will officially be part of the Black Bulls. He manages to deflect Magna's attack back to him. Magna is impressed and gives Asta his robe. From a balcony, Noelle Silva watches the events and scoffs at the other new recruit.\n", "Asta is taken to his new room. He is so excited because he has never had his own room before. Magna Swing tells him to write a letter and send it to the church so that they know that he made it onto a squad. Asta sits down and writes a letter. Yuno is given his own room and told by Klaus Lunettes that he will learn about his Magic Knight duties the next day. The church receives Asta's and Yuno's letters. The church is surprised that both of them passed.\nMagna shows Asta around the Black Bull's base. Magna introduces Asta to the other new recruit, Noelle Silva. Noelle makes fun of him because he is a commoner and she is a member of the royal family House Silva. Asta does not like to be called \"insect\" so he stands up to her. He tells her that they are all equal at Black Bulls. Noelle uses her Water Magic to prove him wrong but her spell veers off course and hits Magna instead. Clearly upset, Magna berates her, so she pulls off her robe and throws it onto the ground before walking away.\nAsta later spies her practicing using her magic by trying to hit a bullseye on a tree. He learns that she has trouble controlling her magic. Realizing that Asta has been watching her practice, Noelle is afraid that he is going to mock her too. She goes to fire a waterball at him but loses control of her magic. She unintentionally traps herself in a giant waterball that is destroying the surrounding area and threatening to drown her. Yami Sukehiro comes up with the idea to throw Asta at the bubble in order to have his sword cut through the spell. Noelle is set free, and Finral Roulacase saves the two from falling to their deaths. Instead of mocking Noelle as she fears, Asta compliments her on how strong her magical powers are. Noelle calls Asta by his name instead of insect. The squad welcomes her back and tell her that she should not feel like a failure because they all are failures. Noelle is given her robe back and Asta offers her a hand to help her get off the ground, which Noelle accepts.\n", "Asta cleans, does the laundry, and feeds the beasts. He tries to wake up Yami Sukehiro, but is yelled at and told to go away. He realizes that he has no idea what Magic Knights are supposed to do. At breakfast in the cafeteria, Asta asks Noelle Silva why she does not help him with the chores. She tells him that it is because she is royalty but Asta believes that is not fair. Asta asks the group what Magic Knights are supposed to do. Magna Swing tells him that they protect the kingdom and handle security. Everyone else gives him their ideal versions of that answer.\nYami arrives and calls Magna to go with him on a mission. Asta asks to come along but Magna says that they cannot bring any kids on an adult mission. Magna and Yami go to a casino and gamble away all their money and personal belongings. Yami asks for one more round and bets his grimoire. Instead, Seihi asks for them to do whatever he asks if he wins. Yami accepts the terms. They walk back to the Black Bulls base naked because they lost. They give Noelle and Asta their first mission as Magic Knights: hunt wild boars near Sosshi. Noelle wonders if she should go since she cannot handle her magical powers. Magna says that this will help her learn to control them and that any mess they make he will clean it up. They ask Finral Roulacase to transport them to the village but he tells them that he cannot go to places he has not been before. Magna says that they will travel by broomstick but neither Noelle nor Asta can fly one. Magna offers to give them a lift on his Crazy Cyclone and flies them to the village.\nMeanwhile, at Sosshi, a group of people teleport there and defeat several boars. Heath Grice tells them that the magic stone is there and that they must find it.\n", "Asta gets chased by a wild boar while Noelle Silva and Magna Swing watch. Noelle tries to use her Water Magic to help him but ends up hitting him with it instead. Asta manages to take one down using his sword. He takes down the other four and they carry them back to Sosshi. Along the way, Magna tells them about his nearby village and how when he was a kid he tried to take over Sosshi. Magna challenged Seihi multiple times but lost every time. Seihi actually had enough power to become a Magic Knight and was the one who told Magna to take the exam. Magna says that Seihi was the one who showed him how to be a \"real man.\"\nThe Black Bulls arrive at the village but find it covered in mist. Magna tells Asta to cut through it with his sword. They end up at the main square and find the townspeople huddled together with deadly ice spikes hanging over them. Magna destroys the spikes with Exploding Buckshot. He finds Seihi on the ground, having been killed. Heath Grice sends a large ice block towards them but Asta saves them by cutting the magic in half. Asta asks Heath why he is there, to which Heath responds that he is getting rid of the townspeople because they are beasts. Asta tells him that he will protect these people.\nHeath and his men create an infinite flurry of icicles. The Black Bulls try to defend the townspeople but Heath keeps creating more icicles. Heath says that if they give up he will let them live but Asta refuses. When Anna begs for Noelle's help, Noelle is inspired and creates a dome of water over everyone to keep out the ice.\n", "Magna Swing is proud of Noelle Silva for creating the Sea Dragon's Nest around the townspeople. Asta uses the cover to jump through and attack Heath Grice but Heath breaks the boy's momentum by creating a patch of ice on the ground. Heath attacks Asta and Asta falls to the ground. Heath walks past him and tries to break through the wall of water. Magna knows that he must fight but is running low on magic. Suddenly, Asta attacks from behind but he is too slow and gets knocked back by ice. He tries again but is still pushed back.\nMagna decides to help Asta so he goes through the water wall to the outside. Magna tells Asta that they should recreate the Black Bull Initiation Ceremony, and unleashes Prison Kill Buckshot before collapsing to the ground. Heath blocks some of the fireballs and lets other pass by, but Asta deflects them back from behind, knocking them into Heath and his men. Meanwhile, Noelle creates a small shield to protect Magna from Heath's counterattack. Heath is engulfed by flames that will not go out. Asta uses this chance to attack him and hit him with his sword. Heath falls to the ground, finally beaten.\nMagna binds the four mages but one manages to escape. Asta collapses and falls asleep. The townspeople thank the trio for their help. An anti-bird flies out of Asta's hood and scouts the village, spotting a light coming from a building. It goes inside and finds the magic stone for which Heath was looking. Magna tells Heath that he is going to tell them everything, like for whom he is working. Instead, Heath encases himself and his two men in ice and they shatter, killing themselves. Later, the trio visit Nick and Anna at their grandfather's grave. Nick tells them that Seihi really admired the Magic Knights but they were also his regret because he did not try harder when he was young. However, he says that Seihi was really proud of Magna. Suddenly, the anti-bird starts attacking Asta. It shows Asta the stone that it found. Nick says that they can keep it as payment for saving their town.\nElsewhere, the escaped mage reports to a shadowed figure wearing a Golden Dawn badge.\n", "Asta, Magna Swing, and Noelle Silva return to the Black Bull's base. Yami Sukehiro tells them to be proud of the fact that they protected the townspeople. Vanessa Enoteca and Finral Roulacase return from the Magic Investigation Department but have no news about who the men were that attacked Sosshi. Yami says that they are going to let the Investigation Department handle it. Yami tells them that the Magic Emperor acknowledged what they did and gave them a star. A star is awarded by the Magic Emperor based on a Magic Knight's performance. Vanessa goes on to explain that a star shows how much work a squad has done. They learn that Golden Dawn is currently at the top with seventy stars. Asta also learns that the Black Bulls have negative thirty stars.\nYami then gives Asta his pay for working as a Magic Knight. He is shocked by how much it is, while Noelle is not very impressed. This upsets Asta who says that it can buy at least 10 years worth of tatoes and that Sister Lily can make anything taste good. Noelle asks who Sister Lily is and Asta responds that she is the woman he is going to marry someday. Vanessa asks what they are going to do with their pay. Asta says that he is going to send some back to the church in Hage. Vanessa tells him to remember to spend some of it on himself and offers to take them shopping.\nThe next day she takes them to the castle town Kikka. Asta is in awe of everything around him. He and Noelle watch as the rest of the Black Bulls spend their money. Vanessa takes the pair to the Black Market. Noelle is unsure about the place but opens up a bit more once Vanessa tells her that there might be a magic tool in the market that will help her control her magic. Noelle tries a necklace but when she tries to use it, her attack hits a man passing by. It turns out to be Sekke Bronzazza. He starts to flirt with them but then Asta shows up. He gets jealous because Asta is with two women. Suddenly, a man grabs a bag from an elderly lady. He runs off and the lady yells for help, so Asta gives chase.\n", "Asta chases after the thief, who is floating on a cloud. Sekke Bronzazza follows after him on his magic scooter. Asta uses his Demon-Slayer Sword to cut through the spell, and the cloud disappears. The thief takes off on foot and Asta continues to follow him. Sekke rams into the thief with his bike. The thief falls to the ground and Sekke stands over him laughing. The thief pulls out a Paralyze Knife and stabs Sekke in the foot, causing Sekke to fall to the ground. Asta kneels at his side and Sekke tells Asta to live out his dream for him since he is going to die. Sekke closes his eyes but he does not die. Asta hits him in the face and yells at him for giving up on life so easily. Vanessa Enoteca puts an ointment on the wound, and Sekke is healed because it was only a numbing poison. Sekke leaves and takes the thief with him. Asta, Vanessa, and Noelle Silva return the stolen bag to the elderly woman. The three of them leave and do not see the elderly woman turn into Julius Novachrono, the Magic Emperor. He has been wandering around looking for new magic.\nThe Magic Emperor spots Klaus Lunettes, Yuno, and Mimosa Vermillion flying overhead and decides to go after them. They are acting as bodyguards for Salim Hapshass on his journey to the Heart Kingdom. Klaus Lunettes wonders why Yuno was picked as one of the bodyguards if he beat Salim during the exam. Salim says that he requested Yuno as a bodyguard because he wanted to apologize. Salim tells him to make sure his dream of becoming the Magic Emperor comes true so he can brag to his children that he once fought the Magic Emperor. Salim asks Yuno to tell him more about him so Yuno tells him about his past. Meanwhile, Klaus is still suspicious about this mission. Suddenly, black clouds appear. Yuno goes to check it out and is attacked by a group of bandits. Yuno falls off his broomstick but ends up defeating the assailants anyway, impressing both Salim and Mimosa. Salim suggests that they visit Yuno's home village to see how he grew up. Klaus tries to protest but Salim is adamant. They fly past the demon skull and arrive at the church. Sister Lily comes out to greet them. Yuno is almost overrun by the children and Father Orsi. They ask them to stay and Salim agrees that they can spare an hour. Yuno gets pulled away by the children while the rest of them head into the church. Klaus is unhappy about the whole situation.\n", "Salim Hapshass, Klaus Lunettes, and Mimosa Vermillion have dinner with Orsi Orfai and Lily Aquaria in the chapel. Yuno asks how much Asta has been sending them and is shocked by the amount. He pledges to send all of his pay the next time. Klaus tells Salim that they should be on their way. Salim says that they can wait a bit more and asks for some more water. Sister Lily says that she has to go fill the water jar and leaves to head to the well. On her way back, one of the bandits kidnaps her. Hearing Lily's scream and the water jar breaking, the others rush outside but are too late. Yuno volunteers to go look for her but Klaus says that their mission is to protect Salim. Yuno disobeys the order to follow them and instead goes in search of Sister Lily. Yuno makes his way through the forest and defeats each bandit as they get in his way. He finds Lily, who is being guarded by the last two bandits. Abra asks for Yuno's grimoire in exchange for Lily because without it he is useless as a Magic Knight. Yuno refuses and ducks just as Klaus launches a Violent Rotating Lance towards Abra. Klaus tells Yuno that this whole thing was set up by Salim because Yuno beat him during the exams and that is why he did not become a Magic Knight. Yuno thanks both Klaus and Mimosa for their help. Klaus decides to take the bandits to the capital but wonders where the last one went. It turns out that Julius Novachrono had captured the last one and disguised himself.\nSister Lily is returned to Hage. Klaus, Mimosa, and Yuno return to the Golden Dawn base where William Vangeance tells them that they have earned a star from the Magic Emperor. Klaus is happy that they got a star but tells Yuno never to go off on his own again. Yuno says okay. Meanwhile, at the Black Bull base, Asta learns of Golden Dawn's star. Asta vows to catch up to them. The Magic Emperor is alerted of an anomaly and he says that he wants them to work on it.\n", "At the Black Bull's base, Asta is doing pushups while Magna Swing sits on his back. They are trying to come up with a name for the bird. They settle on Nero. Yami Sukehiro arrives and tells them that a new dungeon has been discovered. Dungeons are like ancient tombs that contain relics. The dungeon is located near the Diamond Kingdom. Yami says that Asta was chosen specifically by the Magic Emperor to go investigate. Yami also sends Noelle Silva and Luck Voltia along. Finral Roulacase creates a portal to the dungeon. They go inside and look around. Luck senses that this place is full of mana and Noelle feels it too, but Asta cannot. He throws a fit and pounds on the ground accidentally activating trap magic. He summons his sword and negates the magic. Luck goes around and purposefully activates more trap magic for Asta to negate. Vanessa Enoteca is worried about the kids but Yami says that the more difficult the mission the more they will surpass their limits and grow. Luck hypothesizes that the Magic Emperor selected Asta because of his ability to negate magic. Luck senses that someone else is in the dungeon so he goes off to investigate and leaves Noelle and Asta alone. Asta starts talking about becoming the Magic Emperor and tells Noelle about Yuno. Noelle realizes that they are alone together. She charges ahead and gets caught in one of the traps. Asta cuts her out but the vines come back and this time captures both of them. Suddenly, someone fires magic at it and frees them. They turn to see who it could be. Yami remembers that Golden Dawn members were also asked to go investigate the dungeon. Yuno stands there and tells Asta that he has repaid his debt.\n", "Alecdora Sandler asks William Vangeance why he sent Yuno to explore the dungeon. Captain Vangeance tells him to trust him because he trusts Yuno. Klaus Lunettes asks Yuno why he saved Asta and Noelle Silva, as their only mission is to explore the dungeon. Mimosa Vermillion says hello to Noelle and reveals to Asta that she is Noelle's cousin. Noelle is not at all happy to see her and believes that Mimosa is as rude as ever when she asks Noelle how her magic is going. Mimosa brags about them earning a star but Asta and Noelle tell them that they too earned a star. Klaus does not believe them. Klaus asks where the third member of their group is but Noelle and Asta do not know. Klaus says that they are an embarrassment to the Magic Knights. Asta retorts that they are going to be the first to explore the dungeon. Klaus and Asta get into an argument over their captains while Yuno, Mimosa, and Noelle watch. Mimosa uses her magic to learn the layout of the dungeon and Yuno carries them off. Asta and Noelle follow after them. Both Asta and Yuno wonder who is going to get to the treasure chamber first. Nero helps guide Asta and Noelle through the dungeon. Meanwhile, Yuno tells Klaus not to underestimate Asta.\nA messenger reports to the Magic Emperor that a Diamond Kingdom squad, led by the Lotus Whomalt, is also at the dungeon. The Magic Emperor does not seem worried because he knows that those he sent to investigate are strong. Luck defeats Lotus's subordinates and faces off against Lotus himself. Lotus explains that they are invading Clover Kingdom because they are running out of resources, but Luck is only interested in fighting. The room suddenly starts to spin and Luck wonders how if he had not gotten hit by any of Lotus's magic. Lotus reveals that the whole room is filled with his magic. He cast the spell to weaken his abilities while Luck was fighting his subordinates.\nThe Golden Dawns arrive at two large doors. Mimosa suddenly gets hit by magic and collapses. She is injured by a Diamond Kingdom mage. Luck continues to weaken but suddenly gets a second wind and attacks Lotus with more Lightning Magic.\n", "In a flashback, Yuno and Asta talk about how they are more family to each other than any real family they had. Luck Voltia is considered creepy because he is such a happy go lucky child, constantly smiling. His mom hits him and abuses him until he discovers his lightning magic. He uses his magic to defeat a noble which instills fear in his peers. His mom learns about this and tells him that nobody is going to help him in the world. That he must use his magic to continue winning. With this second wind, Luck attacks Lotus Whomalt. Lotus uses his magic to bind Luck in solid smoke. Mimosa Vermillion uses her magic to heal herself while Klaus Lunettes and Yuno face off against the Diamond mage, Mars. Noelle Silva senses Luck's magic as they race down a corridor. Asta wants to go help him but Noelle says that maybe they should leave the fighting to Luck and get to the treasure chamber first. Klaus instructs Yuno to head to the treasure chamber while he deals with the mage. The Diamond mage sends his magic at Klaus but Yuno intervenes. Asta cuts through Lotus's spell and frees Luck. Klaus asks why Yuno came back to save him and Yuno says it is because they are friends that they will defeat the mage and go together. Asta and Noelle try to help Luck but Luck says that he does not need any friends and can defeat Lotus himself. Asta helps him out anyways and Luck realizes that he has never been alone. Lotus envelops them in a Degenerate King's Smoke Prison. Luck uses his lightning to shepherd Lotus in a certain direction so that Asta can hit him with his sword. Luck realizes that teamwork is important. Meanwhile, Yuno and Klaus are having little effect on the Diamond mage.\n", "Lotus Whomalt tries to escape but Asta, Noelle Silva, and Luck Voltia give chase. Unfortunately, Lotus does end up getting away but he is confident that Mars, the Diamond Kingdom mage, can handle it from here. Klaus Lunettes notices the mage stones embedded into Mars's forehead. He believes Mars's magic has been amplified artificially. The Diamond Kingdom has been embedding magical objects into people's bodies so that they can amplify their power. Klaus attacks Mars but he blocks it with a Talos Puppet.\nYuno fights Mars but no matter what he throws at him it does not seem to make a dent. Mars says that his magic has no effect on him and that it is no use. This reminds Yuno of when Asta and he were kids. Asta used to ask Yuno to help him train and how he would not give up until he touched Yuno. Yuno continues to fight even though Mars keeps telling him to give up. Mars brings down his Laevateinn to crush Yuno, but Asta arrives just in time to cut it in half. Asta challenges Yuno to see who can bring Mars down first. Klaus cannot believe that Asta was able to save Yuno when their magic was not working and cannot accept that he was saved by a Black Bull. Mars creates many mineral clones and Asta attacks him. He manages to hit Mars and sends him flying across the room. Luck goes around and starts destroying all of the clones.\nKlaus is still in shock that someone without magic can be so strong. Noelle tells him that Asta's power is negating magic. Klaus thinks that he got lucky getting that power. Mars returns with Heavy Armored Titan and squashes Asta. He asks Asta what he is and Asta tells him that he was born without power and that he is going to be the Magic Emperor. He jumps and shatters the armor, sending Mars falling to the ground. Yuno remembers when they were children and how Asta kept trying to get through his magic until he succeeded.\n", "After Klaus Lunettes restrains the defeated Mars, Asta cuts through the magic door, and the Golden Dawns and Black Bulls rush in to investigate the dungeon's treasures. Yuno finds a scroll with strange writing, which glows and then disappears. Nero points Asta to a lock on the wall, but the boy does not understand.\nSuddenly, Mars frees himself and storms the treasury, coated in Heavy Armored Titan and Phoenix Feathers Robe. Since the other boys are trapped, Asta rushes forward but is knocked through a wall. Noelle Silva tries to extinguish the healing flames, but Mars knocks her aside. Mimosa Vermillion rushes to Noelle's side and begins healing her. Seeing this, Mars attacks the girls.\nNero flies through the wall after Asta and lands atop a sword. With this new sword, Asta returns to the battle and defends the girls. When Asta's strike against Mars is quickly healed, Noelle cheers Asta on and his new sword begins to glow.\nMars and Asta attack each other again, but this time Asta's sword swing releases a blade of water, which hits Mars and extinguishes the flames. Asta then collapses because one of Mars' Harpes hit the boy's stomach.\n", "After Asta collapses, Noelle Silva orders Mimosa Vermillion to go heal Asta instead. Mars, who was not defeated by Asta's attack, stands back up. Seeing Mimosa healing Asta, Mars is reminded of the Diamond Kingdom's experiments, in which he befriended fellow student Fana and was forced to kill her.\nAngered, Mars creates another Laevateinn and brings it down on Mimosa and Asta. Klaus Lunettes, Yuno, and Luck Voltia struggle to free themselves from their crystal restraints. In a burst of strength, Yuno manages to break free but then panics as he does not have a spell to stop the giant sword in time.\nSuddenly, time slows down and Yuno notices a small girl next to him. She yawns and then blows a gust of wind, which shatters Mars' spells and slams him into a wall, defeating him. The others are confused as to what just happened. Asta's new sword then disappears into his grimoire, triggering the collapse of the dungeon.\nYuno creates a Heavenly Wind Ark and the Magic Knights gather on it. Asta pleads for them to take Mars, too, but the ceiling collapses and buries the Magic Warrior. Under Luck's direction, the ark reaches the surface.\nLotus Whomalt escapes after them having hidden his Bustling Lazy Vehicle and followed the other group; the cart is also carrying the other Diamond mages, including Mars. As the cart flies away, Mars' memories return to him and he thanks Lotus for saving him, while remembering the promise he made to Fana.\nAfter Asta is mostly healed, Klaus hugs him and Yuno and apologizes.\n", "Asta cannot believe that he slept for a week after the battle against Mars while investigating the dungeon. He learns that Noelle Silva was worried about him while he slept. Luck Voltia asks him if he is ready to fight but Asta says that he is hungry. When the food is brought to them, he eats more than his fill. Yami Sukehiro walks in and tells him that Magic Knight Headquarters wants a report on what happened in the dungeon. Asta and Noelle head to the Clover Kingdom Royal Capital. They run into Yuno, Klaus Lunettes, and Mimosa Vermillion. Asta tries to say hi to Mimosa but she runs away. Noelle asks her whats wrong and she reveals that she has a crush on Asta.\nThey are greeted at Magic Knight Headquarters by Julius Novachrono, the current Magic Emperor. Julius asks Yuno to perform the magic he used in the dungeon but Yuno says he was only able to use it once. Julius tells him that the spell will grow with him and will one day become an extraordinary power. Asta asks him to read his grimoire as well but Julius cannot understand it. Asta pulls out his new Anti Magic sword and Julius is ecstatic. He asks to hold it but when he does he realizes that it is absorbing his magic. Julius tells Asta that he can wield it because he does not have magic. Asta and Yuno both ask Julius how he became the Magic Emperor. He tells them it was merit, merit to prove that they are the best.\nJulius invites them to a War Merits Conferment Ceremony. There he awards Magic Knights new ranks and medals. After, they are invited to a small reception. Julius excuses himself because something came up. At the reception, the other Magic Knights make fun of Asta. Asta is used to it but then they start in on Yuno, Klaus, Mimosa, and Noelle. Noelle tries to leave but Asta stops her.

Yuno reaches for his grimoire, but Asta manages to summon his larger sword in time and cuts through the bindings. He diverts Solid's magic back at him and makes him kneel. Solid and Asta face off against each other but Nozel Silva interferes by releasing his mana. Fuegoleon Vermillion stops Nozel from punishing Asta because they should be ashamed of themselves for getting so worked up over a little boy. Leopold Vermillion declares Asta his rival. Asta says that Yuno is his rival but Leopold tells him that he can never have enough rivals. Nozel cannot believe that Leopold declared a peasant his rival. Fuegoleon says that Julius Novachrono allowed him to be here saying \"give the kid some credit\". Nozel and Fuegoleon prepare to fight each other when a messenger arrives and tells them that the capital is under attack. The assailant is able to create zombies that terrorize the citizens of the capital. The Magic Knights try to come up with a plan but Asta says that he's just going to go where it's the noisiest. Leopold decides to go after Asta. The rest of the Magic Knights separate into teams and head to different parts of the capital. Fuegoleon and Noelle team up and go looking for Asta.

He asks Rades why he is attacking the innocent people and Rades says that anyone who does not understand his magic is a sinner. Rades summons No.4 - Jimmy and declares Asta his opponent. Jimmy uses curse power and Asta blocks it with his sword. Rades has Jimmy target a little girl but Asta manages to save her. Noelle arrives to help but remembers how her siblings made fun of her and instead calls for help. Fuegoleon hits her on the head and tells her to focus and that it is okay to be weak but staying weak is not. Noelle realizes that if Asta can become stronger so can she. Noelle protects the little girl with her magic freeing Asta to attack Rades. Leopold also helps by killing the zombies that surrounded them. Asta does a spinning attack at Jimmy and knocks him down. Rades summons another zombie, No.2 - Alfred, which is surrounded by electricity. Yuno looks up into the sky and, seeing the column of electricity, worries about Asta.\n", "Nozel Silva wonders what Rades Spirito wants because the zombies are becoming weak.

Rades tells Asta that he is going to win just by watching his corpses do the work, and that he actually has a brain and knows how to use it. Asta does not know what to do and crosses his swords in front of him just as Alfred starts to charge up. Suddenly, a ray of fire engulfs Alfred turning him into ash. Fuegoleon Vermillion walks up to Asta and places a hand on his shoulder. Asta is upset because he could not defeat Alfred on his own. Fuegoleon apologizes for butting in but he did not want Asta to die. Fuegoleon declares him his rival as well since they both want to become the Magic Emperor.\nFuegoleon approaches Rades and tells Asta to leave the rest of the fighting to him. When Asta tries to fight, Fuegoleon hits the boy's head and tells him that he is in no condition to continue fighting. Fuegoleon asks Rades what he wants out of all of this. Rades tells Fuegoleon that he was expelled from the Purple Orca squad because his magic was dangerous, and that he wants revenge for being kicked out of the squad and the kingdom. Rades summons another zombie, No.1 - Carl, and Fuegoleon attacks but gets blocked by a magical barrier. Fuegoleon creates his own barrier and attacks again. This time he manages to break through and kills Carl. Rades is in shock. All around the capital, the zombies start to fall to the ground. The people begin to cheer but floating up above is another mage is waiting to make her move.\n", "Rades Spirito watches as Noelle Silva and Leopold Vermillion defeat his last zombie. Fuegoleon Vermillion binds Rades and confiscates his grimoire. Fuegoleon learns that Rades only has one page in it and that he can only perform one spell. Rades is afraid that they are going to look down on him. Asta tells him that they are not going to look down on him but it is such a waste that he used his magic the way he did. Rades has a magical device in his ear and a person starts talking to him. The voice says that Rades was not strong enough to defeat a captain on his own and that everything is going to go as planned for their master.\nAll over the capital, the Magic Knights are being cheered. Nozel Silva suspects that something is up. Yuno's grimoire starts to glow just as the ground beneath the Magic Knights turns black and swallows them up. They are transported to outside of the Royal Capital. Fuegoleon asks Rades if there is another magic user nearby. Up above, Catherine is upset that she will not get to play with any of the Magic Knights left behind. She casts a spell to absorb the young mana nearby. Yuno intervenes having avoided the Spatial Magic spell. He calls her an old hag, which upsets her and causes her to send Curse Magic at him. He dodges the curses while asking who she is and what she wants. She tells him that they are here to eliminate someone but she does not tell him who it is. Fuegoleon continues to question Rades and learns that they are here for him. Another Spatial Magic spell swallows Fuegoleon, and he reappears in a white dimension. Yuno continues to dodge Catherine's attacks but suddenly gets hit. He can barely see and his body is starting to shut down. Because his other senses are dulled, he is better able to sense mana. He is finally able to summon Sylph and uses her to manipulate the city's mana. He aims the attack at Catherine. Meanwhile, Fuegoleon is surprised when he meets and recognizes a mage in the white dimension.\n", "Charmy Pappitson is busy eating when Catherine bursts through the wall. She approaches Charmy with the intent on stealing her mana. Charmy thinks that she is trying to steal her food so she becomes defensive.

Catherine ends up being captured by the authorities and all the mana she stole gets returned to their owners. Charmy's sheep disappears but her food almost falls out the window. Luckily, Yuno is there to save it. He cannot believe that a kid is the one who stopped Catherine. Charmy becomes flustered around Yuno and Yuno gets lightheaded from using so much mana. He faints but Charmy catches him. Leopold Vermillion grabs Rades Spirito and asks him where Fuegoleon Vermillion is. Noelle Silva says that the mage that sent Fuegoleon away has to be nearby. Asta finds him hiding among the corpses. The mage congratulates Asta on finding him and tells him that it is all over. He brings back Fuegoelon or at least his body minus one arm. His grimoire is still intact which means he is still alive. Noelle tries to stop the bleeding while Leopold freaks out. Rades blasts Leopold away and Rades is about to disappear when Asta starts to run at him. Asta's sword cuts through the magic and keeps Rades from leaving. Asta punches him and Rades asks Valtos to do something. Valtos says that he cannot. Suddenly, a piercing cold magic sweeps in and new mages appear. Asta cuts himself with his swords to stop the curse magic from making him bleed. This allows him to fight more. He tells them that no matter how many people come at him he will blast them all away.\n", "Asta blocks all of the mages' attacks. Leopold Vermillion joins in and helps Asta fight the mages.

He is trying to decide who else to bring with him besides Asta. He thinks of inviting Magna Swing but comes to the conclusion that he is too much of a delinquent. He then considers Gauche Adlai but thinks that his sister complex will scare them away. Gordon Agrippa offers to go with him but Finral does not hear him. He thinks about inviting Charmy Pappitson but feels like the mixer would be over in minutes since she eats so much. His next choice is Yami Sukehiro but he does not like gaudy women so maybe not.

Yami asks Finral if he has recovered enough of his magic for one trip. Finral thinks that they are going home but Yami has something else in mind. Licht thinks about Asta's grimoire and how he needs to take it from him. Yami falls from above him having had Finral use his Spatial Magic to create a portal above Licht. Licht expected this kind of attack and prepares to fire magic at him. Suddenly, Asta appears with his sword. He slashes at Licht and Yami uses his magic to send him to the ground.\nSuddenly, Licht starts floating in the air. Asta has broken the seal on Licht's magic with his sword. Licht asks Asta why he has the Demon-Slayer Sword and Demon-Dweller Sword. Licht says that those belong to and should be with \"the master.\" Asta says that the grimoire and swords are his and his alone. Licht's power begins to build and the others realize that if he releases it will take out the whole area. Yami says that this is their chance to surpass their limits and Asta agrees. Gauche wonders if he has enough magic left to repeal the attack again. Rhya, Vetto, and Fana gather around Licht and use Trinity Seal Magic to seal off his magic. Rhya grabs Valtos and tells the Magic Knights that they are going home; Vetto states that they may have lost this time, but they will lose the next. They disappear leaving the rest behind. Asta wonders if they won since the terrorists ran away, and Yami says that them running away is as good as a win, and Vetto said that they lost. The other captains continue to berate Yami. Asta passes out from exhaustion. Nozel makes a mental note that he best remember Asta.\nElsewhere, Rhya, Vetto, Fana, and Rades Spirito watch as Licht floats in a tube. Rades criticizes the Third Eye mages for their failure which upsets Vetto; Rades then changes the subject to what they should do now; the Magic Emperor will work even harder to learn more about them since they know their leader, George and Catherine are still captive and if they get anything out of them, then the Magic Knights may find out about their base and Licht's true identity which upsets Vetto even further. Rhya calms Vetto down and says that Rades has a good point: it is too early for them to know that. He decides that he must leave and go somewhere despite not wanting to.\n", "Asta wakes up to being healed by Mimosa Vermillion. Klaus Lunettes says that he was worried about him and Mimosa hugs him. This upsets Noelle Silva who pushes Asta into a wall. Asta is shocked to learn that he slept for a whole day. Klaus tells him that they arrived too late to help fight Licht. Asta thanks Mimosa for healing him but Mimosa says that Klaus helped too. Klaus tells him that Neige has been taken into custody but it looks like he might just get volunteer work to make up for his crimes. Yuno says that if he were at the battle, he would not have let the Eye of the Midnight Sun escape. Asta tells him that he's going to continue to get stronger so that he can become the Magic Emperor. Yuno says the same. Klaus, Mimosa, and Yuno leave but not before Mimosa tells Asta that Sister Theresa Rapual woke up and that Gauche Adlai is with her. Gauche thanks Sister Theresa for taking care of Marie Adlai and that he is glad she is alive. Asta arrives and asks how she is doing. Sister Theresa tells him that she is going to tell Sister Lily Aquaria about his good deeds and that she is sure to be proud of him.\nNoelle comes and tells Asta that it is time to go. He asks first to stop at Rebecca Scarlet's home. There he eats a lot of the food she prepared for him. Marco Scarlet gives him back his robe. Rebecca gives him a kiss on the cheek and thanks him for saving her siblings. Asta blushes and Noelle freaks out.\nBack at Black Bull headquarters, Magna Swing has set up a pie-eating contest and has everyone participate. Asta and Charmy Pappitson are the only ones left in the end but the winner turns out to be Charmy. Yami receives a letter and is told to bring Asta along with him to the conference he has with the other Magic Knight Captains. The Magic Emperor wants to see him.\nMeanwhile, Julius Novachrono knows that there is a traitor among them and that he is going to find out who it is tomorrow at the conference. Marx Francois asks if this is going to work and Julius tells him it all depends on Asta. Marx greets Asta and Yami Sukehiro when they arrive for the conference. He brings Asta to the royal prison. He tells him that he thinks his Anti Magic sword may help them reveal who the traitor is. They arrive to find Julius waiting for them. Julius asks him about the fight against the Eye of the Midnight Sun, wanting to know what types of magic they used. Marx interrupts and Julius asks Asta to use his sword to break the spell on his prisoner's memories. Asta taps the two prisoners on the head with the Demon-Slayer Sword and breaks the spell. Marx uses his Memory Magic to go through their memories and ask them questions.\nMeanwhile, at the conference, the Magic Knight Captains talk about how many stars each of them have. William Vangeance arrives late and Nozel Silva asks him why he is late again. William says that he had other business to take care of and Nozel wonders if that is why he was not at the War Merits Conferment Ceremony either. Yami gets impatient and wonders where Julius is since he is the one who called them here. Marx appears and summons them to the prison below. William asks why the Magic Emperor wants them here. He tells them that thanks to Asta he has learned that there is a traitor among them.\n", "Julius Novachrono asks Catherine and George to reveal who the traitor among the Magic Knight Captains is. They say that it is Gueldre Poizot. Gueldre tries to deny it but Charlotte Roselei says that she has heard some rumors about him. Gueldre continues to proclaim his innocence and Yami Sukehiro suggests that he allow Marx Francois to look at his memories. Marx says that if he is truly innocent, then he will allow him to look at his memories. Gueldre panics and uses his magic to turn himself invisible. He sends invisible knights to fight the Magic Knight Captains while he makes his escape. Asta goes after him and uses his sword to negate his magic. Gueldre asks how he knew he was there and it is because Asta sensed his ki. He is then trapped into a magic painting by Rill Boismortier. The rest of the captains catch up and Julius tells Gueldre that he has some questions for him.\nRill proclaims Asta his new friend. Julius makes Gueldre confess to a list of crimes that he has committed. He is responsible for kidnapping barrier mages while conspiring with the Eye of the Midnight Sun. Julius says that in order to keep the citizens calm, they will not make this a public matter. But to make sure that this does not happen again, Julius orders them to check their squads and make sure that no one has ties to the enemy. It is revealed that Rhya was there in disguise as a Magic Knight Captain.\nJulius has Asta and Yami stay behind and tells them that he learned more about the stone tablet. That they are collecting magic stones to put into the tablet so that they can be reborn into their true forms and gain enormous power. That is why they went after Fuegoleon Vermillion because he had a magic stone. Julius reveals that he knows the location of one of the stones: the Seabed Temple. Julius says that it is especially dangerous to go there because it is a Grand Magic Zone. He asks Yami if he and the Black Bulls can go retrieve the stone for him. Yami says that he just has to give the order. Yami remembers when he first met Julius. Julius tells Asta that he is essential to the quest because they need his Anti Magic to get into the Grand Magic Zone. Asta is in awe that he is needed because he thought that nobody expected anything from him since he did not have magic. Yami says that he let him join the Black Bulls because he knew that he could do it. Back at headquarters, Yami tells them that they are going to the Seabed Temple. Everyone gets excited that they are going to the beach but Yami says that they are going for work, not play.\n", "Yuno, Mimosa Vermillion, and Klaus Lunettes were heading home from a mission, when they heard a scream and thought it was a robbery. Upon landing to check it out, they find Noelle Silva and Vanessa Enoteca trying on swimsuits. Klaus accused them of fooling around, but Vanessa denied it and told them it was for a secret mission. Meanwhile, Charmy Pappitson fantasizes about Yuno and wonders what he will think of her swimsuit, but he is gone before she can ask. The Black Bulls all head out for Raque to enjoy a day at the beach, accidentally leaving Gordon Agrippa behind. While Noelle is nervously trying to show Asta her swimsuit, Magna Swing and Luck Voltia are racing around the beach, Finral Roulacase is failing at flirting with girls, Gauche Adlai is using his mirror projection to talk with his sister, and Charmy is trying to smash a watermelon blindfolded, with Vanessa trying to help her from a distance.\nAsta then remembers that they had a mission to do, chastising everyone for goofing off. He is kicked from behind by Yami Sukehiro, who chastises him for doing the same thing as his teammates. Yami buries his squad in the sand for goofing off, and fills them in on the info he got on how to get to the Seabed Temple, surprising a few members, as he was actually doing his job. Yami then states that Noelle is the only person who can get them there. To her dismay, she tells him that even if she tried she would fail, as she does not believe she could control her magic well enough to get them there safely. Yami reminds her that this mission was given to the Black Bulls specifically and tells her no one else can do it, and then gives her one week to surpass her limits.\nLater that night Noelle is seen practicing her magic and thinking about the tricks Vanessa taught her, none of which have worked. She doubts her ability to control her magic by the end of the week. Before she can practice anymore, Asta runs through her ball of water, with crabs latched onto him. She asks if he was training and he asks her the same question. When she claims she was not, Asta decides that they should train together and promises to help if her magic goes out of control like before. After thinking it over for a while, she accepts, but Asta is distracted by a strange noise. Investigating, they come upon a strange girl standing on a rock and singing, facing the ocean.\n", "Julius Novachrono tries to escape working but Marx Francois scolds him and forces him to sit down at his desk. Julius wishes he could have gone to the Seabed Temple and Marx hopes that the Black Bulls are not just messing around.\nAsta and Noelle Silva come across a girl who is singing atop of a rock. Asta wonders if she is a water spirit. When the girl catches them listening, she introduces herself as Kahono and proclaims that they are going to be friends. They ask her why she was singing out here and she says that she has a dream to be a singing, magic-wielding idol. Kahono suddenly asks Asta if it hurts when he moves and he asks her how does she know that. She says that is her power and uses her Song Magic to heal him. She asks him to pay her for the healing and he hands over 100 yuls. She insists that they be friends and both Asta and Noelle agree. Kahono asks why they are here and Asta tells her that they are looking for the Seabed Temple before Noelle can stop him. Kahono asks what they were doing out here and Noelle tells her that she was training on how to focus her magic before the next full moon. Kahono asks her to show her her magic and after that, she gives Noelle some advice. She tells her to relax and to calm her heart. She also asks her what is the kindest memory she has. Noelle remembers how her family shunned her for killing their mother during birth. She thanks Kahono for the advice but turns away from her.\nAs the week goes by, Noelle continues to practice with Asta and Kahono's encouragement. The rest of the Black Bulls continue to mess around on the beach. The night before the full moon, Asta tells Noelle to let go of her magic. Noelle protests but Asta says he will use his Anti Magic to save her if anything happens. Noelle lets loose her magic but does not think it is going to work. As she floats there, she looks down and sees the rest of the Black Bulls cheering her on. She realizes that she does have some kind memories after all and creates a new spell. Suddenly, she falls from the sky after having used so much magic and Asta catches her. She slaps him for touching her so casually. She turns to tell Kahono that they did it but cannot find her. Yami says that she surpassed her limits and that it is time for them to go. Kahono tells Noelle that she will see her again inside the temple.\n", "Yami Sukehiro tells them that today is the day to enter the Seabed Temple since the full moon has finally arrived. Asta asks Noelle Silva if she is nervous and she says no. Vanessa Enoteca offers her a drink to calm down but Magna Swing tells her that is not a good idea. Noelle steps forward and casts her spell that surrounds them in a water bubble. She takes them into the ocean but as they get to the Grand Magic Zone's entrance, the waters turn turbulent. They push through the currents and finally arrive at the Temple. The temple is surrounded by a magic barrier so Yami sends Asta out to use his Anti Magic sword on it. Asta tells him that he just realized he cannot swim but Yami throws him out of the water bubble anyway.\nAsta slashes through the barrier and lands on the other side. Heis surprised to learn that there is air down here. The others arrive and Charmy Pappitson makes them a cotton platform so that they can float down to the Temple. Magna tells them to keep their guards up because they are in the Grand Magic Zone. They notice that the area also includes houses and learn that people actually live down here. Yami asks them to take them to the leader of the temple and the people tell them that it is the high priest. Asta says that things are going smoothly as they head towards the priest. Noelle says he is probably not used to it since he is used to almost dying all the time.\nThey arrive at the entrance of the temple and walk inside. The people outside tell them to say hi to the priest and to talk to them when they come back, if they come back. The doors close behind them. They meet the priest who is a hyperactive old man. He asks if they are after the magic stone. Magna asks how he knows that they are and he says that he has eyes. Magna, Gauche Adlai, and Luck Voltia scheme on how they can take the magic stone. The priest says that if they play a game, he will throw a banquet in their honor should they win. Yami asks what type of game they are going to play and the priest says they will have a Temple Battle Royale.\nThe priest calls other priests to join him. Suddenly, everyone is transported to different locations within the temple. This forces each of them to face off against a warrior mage priest alone. The priest tells them that whichever team has the most members left in the end wins. The only one who is excited about this game is Luck. Asta gets paired with an octopus-masked mage. Since the mage does not sense any magic on Asta, he thinks that he selected a dud. Asta tells him to come and find out if he did get paired up with a loser.\n", "The priest Gifso invites Yami Sukehiro to sit down and watch the fights with him. Yami is upset that he was not allowed to participate in the game. The priest tells him that he is too strong and that this is an important fight for him and the people outside of the temple. Yami relents and sits down with the priest to watch the fights. The priest asks Yami what ranks the knights are and he tells him that they are all Junior Magic Knights. The priest believes he has the upper hand because his mages are more powerful than them. Yami points out that the knights are stronger than usual despite their titles. They watch as Magna Swing, Luck Voltia, Gauche Adlai, and Asta begin to attack the mages, and the Black Bulls defeat their individual opponents in seconds.\nAsta runs off to find more mages to battle. Yami tells Gifso that they should bet on which team is going to win. Yami bets that the Black Bulls are going to win but Gifso responds that the game is just beginning and that they will not be able to beat the other mages so easily. Finral Roulacase tries to find a way out but somehow cannot get to the places that he marked outside. Gifso announces that they will not be able to leave until the game is over. Yami tells Finral to stop hiding and to fight. Gifso sends a giant fish to chase after Finral. They check in on Charmy Pappitson who is eating as per usual. Kahono arrives and Charmy challenges her, but Kahono puts Charmy to sleep. Yami swears that Charmy will not get food for a week. Magna and Luck arrive in the same cave opening. They both see Gio but Luck attacks first. Luck's Thunderclap Crumbling Orb does not make it through Gio's Sea God's Shield, much to Luck's surprise.\nAsta kills monsters from Gifso's nuisance spell. He runs into Kiato, who starts to dance. Asta watches in awe and Kiato explains that he wants to be the best dancer but cannot go to the capital because it is not allowed. He says that if they do beat the Black Bulls, then Gifso said that they could go up to the surface. Asta realizes that he has heard that story somewhere before. Kiato attacks him but Asta tells him about his dream to become the Magic Emperor. Kiato's mask breaks and falls off as the two of them fight each other.\nNoelle Silva runs into Kahono, who reveals that she was sent to the surface to look for people who wanted to come to the Seabed Temple. She explains that if they win then she can go to the surface and become an idol. Noelle is hurt because she believes that Kahono used her. Kahono says that they can still be friends as she uses her lullaby spell on Noelle. Noelle uses Sea Dragon's Nest to block the music. She tries to attack Kahono but the spell veers off target. Kahono tells Noelle that she can control her magic but she does not want to hurt people.\nMeanwhile, Asta fights Kiato but is not making any progress because of Kiato's unusual fighting style. Asta realizes that he needs to adjust his fighting style and finally manages to land a blow. Vanessa Enoteca beats her mage by capturing him in her web. Yami regrets not having bet more. Yami asks Gifso if he could get the magic stone ready because the Eye of the Midnight Sun is after it. Gifso tells him that the game is not over yet and that if his son and grandchildren get serious that they are definitely going to win. During Magna and Luck's fight with Gio, a magic whale smashes into the temple and crushes Gio. Vetto and the Eye of the Midnight Sun have come to join in on the fun.\n", "Mimosa Vermillion wonders if Asta is looking up at the same moon as she, Yuno, and Klaus Lunettes walk. Sekke Bronzazza witnesses Vetto beating a bunch of senior knights before using his magic to dive into the water with his goons. Sekke cannot believe the Magic Knights were beaten and calls Vetto a beast.\nIn the Seabed Temple, Magna Swing and Luck Voltia are standing before Vetto. Gio recovers and asks Vetto why he is there. Vetto tells him that he is after the magic stone too. Gio tells him that he is not just going to hand it over. Vetto says that he is going to spread despair and seize it from them. Gio tries to hit him with Sea God's Hammer but Vetto blocks with Rhinoceros Armor. Vetto then blitzes the three of them and sends them flying into the walls.\nGifso cannot believe that Gio was beaten so easily. Yami Sukehiro tells him to get him in there so he can help. Gifso says that his Game Magic will not allow it because it goes against the rules of the game. Yami says that he will let himself out and cuts a hole in the wall, but the way is blocked by a Spatial Magic spell. Vetto tells Yami that he can sense him and that he is going to be his main fight after he defeats the rest of the Black Bulls. Yami has Gifso project his voice out into the arena so that the others can know about Vetto and his underlings. He tells them to surpass their limits and that if they die, he will kill them. Gifso changes the rules of the game so that there is no time limit and that if they destroy Vetto, he will grant them any wish within his power. Asta and Kiato put their match on hold to go fight Vetto.\nVetto goes to leave but Magna and Luck tell him that they are not dead yet. Magna realizes though that if they get hit one more time they are done for. Luck baits Vetto and tells him to hit them again, much to Magna's surprise. Vetto attacks but Luck dodges and manages to get a hit on Vetto but it has no effect. The two of them fight each other for a while. Meanwhile, Magna thinks about his relationship with Luck. He realizes that Luck is his best friend. Magna attacks Vetto and joins in the fight. Luck remembers when he first met Magna and realizes that Magna is his very first friend. Asta and Kiato continue to run in the direction of the fight. Kiato asks how he knows where they are going if he cannot sense mana. Asta explains that he can sense ki. He asks Kiato why it was hard to sense his ki earlier. Kiato explains that when he dances he puts himself into a trance and that his body moves without him thinking, making his movements unpredictable.\nThey are almost to the fight and sense what is going on up ahead. Asta tells Kiato that Luck and Manga are reliable and will not die. Luck and Magna get knocked down but stand up after having a vision of Asta. As they attack Vetto, they decide to combine their magic and shoot it at him. Asta and Kiato arrive just as they do this.\n", "Despite their combined spell, Magna Swing and Luck Voltia were not able to beat Vetto. Magna and Luck collapse on the ground. Vetto goes to give the finishing blow but Asta blocks him. Asta tells Vetto that he will take on the challenge of beating him. He manages to slice Vetto across the stomach. Asta tells him that they know that the Eye of the Midnight Sun is up to something. Vetto says that he is not going to tell him because he does not have any magic. He tells Asta to attack him. Asta and Kiato attack Vetto. They barely graze him. Vetto says that he did not expect much from them. Asta and Kaito tell Vetto that they will show him what they can do. They run at him as Yami Sukehiro and Gifso watch.\nGauche Adlai and Zarick fight, and Gauche is forced to run from the enemy's Chain Magic. Gauche is trying to think of what to do when a crab comes and pulls at his pants leg. Gauche returns to battling the mage but this time shows up with his double. Zarick defeats the double, which leaves Gauche open for attack. However, the real Gauche appears behind Zarick and defeats him with Large Reflect Ray.\nGrey and Gauche go to find Charmy Pappitson but become entangled in vines. Zuta uses the vines to drain their magic. Gauche tries to get Charmy to help them but she is fast asleep. Gauche believes that he has to do this on his own but remembers how Asta told him that they are a team. Gauche comes up with a plan to have Grey transform a rock into a piece of meat. He then tells Charmy that someone is trying to steal her food. Charmy wakes up and attacks Zuta. Charmy's sheep punches Zuta unconscious, and Charmy is upset that the rock is not really meat. Suddenly, Grey's transformation wears off and her true form is revealed. Grey is actually a girl and she is embarrassed not to be transformed into something else. Charmy is shocked to also learn that Grey is older than her and that she and Gauche are the same age.\nMeanwhile, Asta and Kiato get hit into a wall as they are no match for Vetto. Vetto lists all of Asta's failures and tells him that Asta does not know when to quit as Asta continues to come at him. That arrogance is what will mortally wound him. Vetto holds Asta up by his arm as he begins to squeeze. Asta bites Vetto just as Kahono and Noelle Silva arrive.\n", "Yami Sukehiro and Gifso watch as Noelle Silva and Kahono arrive to fight Vetto. Noelle looks around and sees that Magna Swing, Luck Voltia and even Asta were beaten so easily. Asta suddenly gets up and attacks Vetto but he swats him away. Kahono uses her magic to cushion Asta's fall. Noelle asks Kahono if she can heal all of them but Kahono is sceptical that Vetto is going to let her do so. Kahono notices that Kiato has fallen and screams at him to get up. Kiato gets up and the two of them vow to continue pursuing their dream together. They attack Vetto. Kahono uses her voice while Kiato dances. They use a combo spell and Kiato actually lands a blow on Vetto. Gifso watches his grandchildren fight. He knows that all of the hard work they have put into perfecting their craft is going to pay off. Despite their combo spell, Kiato cannot seem to get past Vetto's guard. Vetto attacks Kiato and rips off his foot. He then goes for Kahono and strikes her in the throat. Gifso tries to help by using his magic to create monsters but Vetto destroys those too.\nVetto holds Kahono by her hair and decides that he is going to remove her eyeballs as well. Before he can, Noelle yells at him to stop. Noelle cannot bring herself to attack though because she is not confident with her magic. Vetto continues to torture Kahono. Noelle suddenly hears Kahono's voice in her mind, encouraging her to attack reassuring her that she will be able to control her magic. Noelle begins to glow blue as she steps up. The ground begins to shake and she tells Vetto again to let go of her friend. Vetto realizes that she is royalty and says that she comes from the most corrupt clan. He tells her to come at him because he is going to force her to her knees. Noelle uses her magic to create a water dragon and aims it at him. Vetto tries to hold it off but in the end it succeeds in grabbing him. The dragon flies about the room before breaking through the temple to the outside world. Afterwards, Vetto stands but he is missing his left arm. Yami is proud of Noelle and cannot believe that she has that kind of magic in her. \nVetto suddenly grows a third eye on his forehead. He tells Noelle that she was able to draw him out. He uses his magic to regrow his arm. Both Gifso and Yami say that it is impossible. Yami tells Noelle to run. Noelle takes a look around at her fallen comrades and says that she is not going anywhere. Vetto attacks Noelle and Noelle tries to defend herself but realizes her last spell took all her magic. After the attack dissipates, it is revealed that Asta jumped in front of Noelle and used his sword to negate the magic. He tells Vetto that he is not ready to give up yet. Vetto tells them that he is going to show them true despair.\n", "Sekke Bronzazza is going to go get help when he begins to sense a ton of mana coming from the ocean. Vanessa Enoteca pauses her fight because she too senses the mana. Toike tells her that he is going to take all her magic. Vanessa tells him that she is going to defeat him and go and find her comrades. While looking at Vetto, Noelle Silva thinks about the tale of the first Magic Emperor and how he went up against a demon like this. Vetto attacks Noelle but Asta jumps in front of her and negates his magic. Yami Sukehiro tries to break out of the room but cannot get past the Spatial Magic. Yami tells Abari that he is going to beat him up if he does not let him out. Meanwhile, Vanessa fights Toike but his magic is strong. He uses a spell that makes her cover her ears. The mage goes to finish her but Vanessa dodges his attack. She continues to dodge his attacks until she gets cornered. He is about to finish her when he realizes that he cannot move. She has trapped him in her threads. She turns his attack on him and he sucks the magic out of himself and faints. Vanessa uses his mana to replenish her own.\nNoelle asks Asta how he is standing and he tells her that Kahono used the last of her strength to heal him. Asta tells her that he is amazed by the spell she used and that she is as awesome as he thought. Finral Roulacase stands in the shadows trying to avoid fighting. Finral realizes that there is no way they are going to be able to beat Vetto, even if they team up. Finral sees the hole in the cave and decides that someone should survive so he goes to escape. As he does, he overhears Asta telling Vetto that he is not going to give up until he fulfills his wish. Vetto says that before they fight he is going to kill everyone else. He aims his magic at everyone who has fallen but luckily Vanessa shows up and is able to pull everyone out of harms way. Vanessa tells them that she is there to backup Asta as she wraps her thread around Vetto. She finally knows why the Black Bulls like Asta: because he never gives up. \nVetto breaks free and aims another attack at the three of them. Asta realizes that he will not get to it in time. Finral decides to join in and uses his magic to send Vetto's attack back at him. Vanessa tells Noelle to use the rest of her magic to protect the fallen. Vanessa tells them that one hit from Vetto and they are done for. Finral regrets joining their cause but Vanessa tells him that if he stays she will hug him afterwards. This motivates him to join in. They attack Vetto but Vetto again deflects the attack. Vetto decides to kill them up close and goes for Asta. But Asta manages to avoid him with the help of both Finral and Vanessa. Finally, Asta appears out of one of the portals and manages to slice Vetto with his sword. He tells Vetto that he is going to beat him with this weapon.\n", "Vetto gets hit in the face by Asta. He cannot heal the wound because the sword negates magic. Vetto admits that Asta's weapon might be the only thing that can defeat him. Vetto runs at them and Asta rushes to meet him. When they would have collided, Asta disappears through a portal and reappears on Vetto's side. He slices him again but the wound is not deep. Finral Roulacase and Vanessa Enoteca realize that they have to get Asta closer if they want him to cause more damage. Elsewhere, Gauche Adlai and Grey are sitting on the ground because both have used up all their magic. Gauche tells Charmy Pappitson that she should go on without them but finds her eating. Again. She tells them that they should eat and recover their magic. Gauche reluctantly agrees that Charmy has a point. Asta continues his attacks on Vetto and continues to be pulled and transported to different areas of the cave by Vanessa and Finral. Gifso cheers them on but is upset that his son and grandchildren are hurt. He tells them to get revenge. Yami Sukehiro is impressed by Asta, Vanessa, and Finral for working together. He believes that together they have surpassed their limits. Vanessa realizes too late that Vetto's timing is starting to match their attacks. She tries to pull Asta out of harm's way but he gets cut anyway.\nAsta tells them that he is fine and that they should continue their attacks. Yami interrupts him and tells them that Vetto was purposefully not attacking as much in order to understand their habits. Yami warns him that if he goes in unprepared, Vetto is going to catch him. Asta says that they have to try. He calls Yami out and tells him to come help them. This gets Yami mad but he tells Asta that he needs to calm down too. They can attack but they just have to change it up. The trio agree to surpass their limits even more. They speed things up and make it harder for Vetto to catch Asta. Asta manages to land a few good slices. Vanessa remembers when she used to live in the Forest of Witches. How she was kept in a cage by the order of the Queen of Witches. She thought it was her fate to be trapped there but she realized later that she lacked the courage to leave. Vanessa tells Asta to trust her and allow her to make his movements. Asta agrees. Finral complains that they are going too fast.\nFinral remembers that as a child he was reprimanded for having weak magic because he did not want to attack people. He was called a weakling and even his younger brother, Langris Vaude, surpassed him. When he was older, he was put down for having joined the Black Bull while Langris joined the Golden Dawn. He was disinherited and Langris was made heir instead. He remembers when he met Asta and how he had no magic but still kept fighting. Finral says that he may not be the strongest but that he will strive to make the Black Bulls the strongest squad. He tells Asta to trust him and Asta says that he already does 100%. Vetto muses that they are soon going to reach their limits and wonders how long they will last. Asta tells him until they beat him. Both Finral and Vanessa realize that because Asta believes in them they can never betray that trust. Vetto asks about their magical limit and says that they will probably reach it soon and that it is the difference between him and them, saying that he has way more mana than they do. Asta says that he is going to believe in them both and win.\nJust as he goes to attack, Vetto gets hit by a ray of light. Gauche, Charmy, and Grey appear revitalized and ready to fight. Gauche lures Vetto closer so that Charmy can use her sheep magic to hit him. Grey uses her magic to create many Astas and they all attack Vetto at once. Vetto is getting tired of this and tells them to despair already. Asta appears and stabs him in the torso. He tells Vetto that they do not have time for that.\n", "Asta stabs Vetto and Finral Roulacase and Vanessa Enoteca think that they have won. Vetto grabs Asta and tells them that he let them injure him so that he could take away Asta's weapon. Asta falls to the ground but tells Vetto that he is not ready to give up yet. The others agree with him and ready themselves to continue fighting. Vetto goes to attack a now unarmed Asta but Vanessa pulls him out of the way. Gauche blasts Vetto with his mirror and uses up the last of his magic. Noelle also sends a water attack at Vetto but both attacks are deflected. Vanessa realizes that Asta is different from them and that that difference is what is going to get him to the top in this world. Vanessa tells Asta that she will support his broken arm so that he can continue to fight.\nAsta runs at Vetto and Vetto asks him why he does not despair. Asta tells him that his despair is getting in the way of the promise that he made with Yuno. Vetto is unable to follow Asta's moves because the Demon-Slayer Sword is still inside him. He pulls it out in order to regain those magical abilities. He knocks Asta out of the sky. Suddenly, Vetto sees a vision of Asta's devil. Asta regains his balance and begins to approach him. Vetto realizes that Asta is like him, that he is a devil, but one who devours everything including despair. Asta continues to attack Vetto and continues to slice him up. Finally, he delivers a killing blow and Vetto falls to the ground. His magic has disappeared and Noelle is sure that they have won this time. \nEveryone celebrates but Yami wonders what that power was that he sensed coming from Asta. Vanessa checks out the wounded and Asta says that he hopes that Kahono and Kiato will be able to sing and dance again. Finral and Vanessa thank Asta for believing in them because that is why they were able to win. Noelle asks for compliments and Vanessa says that it is time to celebrate by drinking. Asta tells her that it is not the time to drink. That they need to tie up Vetto and ask him questions about the Eye of the Midnight Sun. Meanwhile, an unconscious Vetto remembers a time when he and Licht found an injured bird. He regains consciousness and his magic returns. Yami breaks the table because he knows that they will not be able to beat him. \nAsta tells the others that they can beat him again. They all rally around him. Suddenly, Yami appears having broken through the Spatial Magic. Yami tells them that he can take it from here. That they all did a good job. That being kept up in that room helped push him to the limits and created a new magic spell for him. He tells Vetto that his magic can cut through dimensions and sends an attack towards him. He cuts through Vetto's magic and Vetto begins to fall. Yami tells him that he will see him later.\n", "Vetto falls onto the ground and Yami Sukehiro confesses that he did not despair. Everyone gathers around Yami and congratulates him. He pulls out his sword and tells them that they are annoying him. Gifso thanks them for protecting the Seabed Temple and tells them that he will grant them a wish. Yami asks for the magic stone but Gifso does not know where that is. Suddenly, Nero comes flying in with the magic stone grasped in its beak, drops the stone in Yami's palm, and goes to rest on top of Asta's head. Yami tells the group that they did good. All of a sudden, Asta falls to the ground followed by everyone else who is exhausted and overwhelmed from the fight. Gifso tells them that they will tend to their wounds and help them recover their magic.\nElsewhere, the Eye of the Midnight Sun is upset because the Black Bulls defeated Vetto. Fana tells them that she will not forgive them for making Licht sad. They realize that they must take back the magic stone so that they can fulfill their mission.\nThe Black Bulls are all laying down recovering. Suddenly, they look outside and see a crowd has gathered. They thank the Black Bulls for saving their lives. Noelle Silva visits Kahono and Kiato. She apologizes to Kahono for not being able to protect her but Kahono tells her that her magic was amazing. Noelle says that it is because of Kahono's help. Kahono believes that she is going to heal and says that Noelle better come listen to her sing. Noelle promises that she will go and the two of them link pinkies. Noelle leaves and Kiato tells Kahono that she has to introduce him to Noelle later. Kahono tells him that she thinks Noelle is unavailable.\nAsta goes exploring and runs into Yami. The captain asks if he found anything while he explored and Asta tells him that he almost got swallowed by a giant sea anemone. He also found some pretty flowers that he places at Vetto's grave. Asta says that he cannot forgive the Eye of the Midnight Sun but he realizes that they must have something that they can not forgive as well. Yami tells him not to think too hard about it and that he should keep chasing his dream. Yami pulls his headband down and blinds Asta before he walks away.\nLater, Asta is laying down when he remembers how he showed Yuno his grimoire when he first got it. He remembers the promise he made with Yuno to see who would become the Magic Emperor. Asta says that he will continue to pursue his dream because he is not ready yet and needs to get stronger.\nThe Black Bulls say goodbye to the Seabed Temple and its inhabitants. Asta tells Kahono and Kiato to keep pursuing their dreams. Kiato winks at Noelle. Finral Roulacase opens a portal and everyone starts walking through it. Noelle and Asta pause when they start to hear Kahono sing. Everyone joins in singing. Asta walks through the portal but Noelle hangs back to wave at Kahono one last time. Finral is the last to walk through the portal as it closes behind them.\n", "Asta congratulates everyone on a job well done back at the Black Bull base. They remember suddenly that they forgot Gordon Agrippa, who is sitting in a corner upset. Yami Sukehiro tells the squad that he is going to go report to Julius Novachrono. He says that Charmy Pappitson is going with them so that she can bring along the prisoners and Finral Roulacase will transport them there. Asta also asks if he can come but Noelle Silva reprimands him and tells him that he needs to rest. Yami agrees that he should stay but since he was there when the Magic Emperor gave them the mission, Yami allows him to come with them.\nThey arrive at the Royal Capital and Yami dismisses Finral allowing him to go flirt with cute girls. In his office, Julius tells the Black Bulls that he sent Vetto's corpse for an autopsy and will interrogate the other prisoners that they brought back. Julius praises Charmy for her Restraining Magic and Yami hands over the magic stone. Julius praises them for accomplishing this mission and also points out that Yami has gotten stronger because of it.\nJulius remembers when he first appointed Yami as a Magic Knight captain and tells him that he has become a magnificent captain. Yami responds that he has just proved that Julius was right and that his Magic Knights proved that Yami was right. Julius congratulates Asta on his newest achievement and tells him that he is one step closer to becoming the Magic Emperor. Asta asks him if he can have his autograph and Yami gets mad at him.\nSuddenly, Marx Francois interrupts their meeting and tells Julius that Kiten is under attack by a Diamond Kingdom army. Marx shows them a visual and Asta asks why there are so many people attacking. The group is being led by Ragus, Broccos, and Yagos, three of the Eight Shining Generals. Asta asks what that is and Yami explains that they are the eight strongest of the Diamond Kingdom.\nThe generals say that if they conquer Kiten, it will give their forces an advantage and resources. A group of Purple Orca form a defensive line atop Kiten's wall to prevent army from invading. They activate the magical barrier and focus their attacks on Ragus in order to take him out first. Ragus' subordinates protect him with a barrier, and Ragus retaliates with his Thunderbird Cavalry: Sky-Splitting Magic Bow Armament, which pierces and brings down Kiten's barrier. The army charges ahead and enters the town.\nAll hope seems lost as Yami, Asta, Marx, and Julius watch from a distance. Suddenly, several Golden Dawns arrive ready to turn the tide of the battle. Yuno attacks Broccos and blows him away. Sylph tells Yuno to use her magic and that he does not make friends because he never smiles. Sylph tells him to hurry up and defeat these guys so that they can go on a date. Yuno refuses, much to Sylph's dismay. Julius marvels at the wind spirit and wants to meet her in person. Charmy is excited to see her meal-saving prince, while Asta just grins. Julius tells them that he would like to send reinforcements to help. Yami asks if he wants them to go but Julius asks if he is sure since they just returned from the Seabed Temple. Yami says that he feels invincible and that he is concerned about someone there. Julius says that he would like to go but he cannot leave the capital. Yami wishes he had brought Finral to the office so that they could head over to Kiten. Asta asks if he can go but Yami tells him he will just get in the way because he is injured. Charmy promises to protect Asta. Yami relents and tells them that they can come. The three of them go in search of Finral.\nMeanwhile, William Vangeance and Langris Vaude watch the battle. They decide to make the Diamond Kingdom regret stepping foot in their country.\n", "Finral Roulacase is flirting with some cute girls when Yami Sukehiro, Asta, and Charmy Pappitson arrive. Yami tells Finral to make a portal to Kiten. Meanwhile, in Kiten, Yuno is going about against Broccos, one of the eight Shining Generals. Ragus offers to help but Broccos wants Yuno for himself. Ragus asks Yuno if he can protect himself and the townspeople. He shoots lightning arrows at Yuno but Yuno uses his Wind Magic to send the attack right back at Ragus. Broccos asks Ragus if he wants his help now. Ragus tells Broccos that Yuno is his. The two of them start to bicker over who gets to fight Yuno. General Lotus cannot believe Yuno got so strong as he watches from the sidelines. \nThe Golden Dawn continues to fight against the Diamond Kingdom. Yagos uses his magical slime to trap and weaken the other Magic Knights. Langris Vaude tells Yagos that his spells are useless against his own. He fires his Spatial Magic at him and destroys Yagos along with the building behind him. Lotus watches as vines begin to cover the buildings. He believes that William Vangeance is going to create a huge tree to protect the city. Lotus touches one of the vines and his power gets sucked in. Lotus tries to warn the other generals about this but they are too busy arguing over Yuno. Suddenly, Vangeance releases his magic and a great tree blooms in the middle of the city. As it does, it takes many of the enemies captive. \nAsta, Charmy, Yami and Finral arrive in Kiten. They are in awe of the huge tree. Yami tells them that he's going to go talk to Vangeance while they help the townspeople. Finral is worried because Asta is hurt and Charmy is...drooling. Vangeance has taken out most, if not all, of the army. This upsets Ragus and Broccos. Meanwhile, Asta helps to direct people to safety with Charmy and Finral's help. Suddenly, they look up into the sky and notice that Yuno is battling Ragus. Yuno beats him with a single blow. He lands next to Asta and notices that he's hurt. Yuno says that Asta has gotten stronger and Asta says that so has he. Both promise not to lose to each other.\nMimosa Vermillion and Klaus Lunettes show up and are clearly worried about Asta's condition. Klaus tries to play it off and Mimosa worries that she's been too forward. Klaus and Mimosa leave to go help the others but Klaus tells Yuno to stay close to Asta since he cannot fight. Broccos finds Vangeance up in the tree. Vangeance tells him to retreat but Broccos says never. Broccos attacks him and grabs Vangeance in his hands. But Vangeance releases a spell that creates another tree and traps him. Suddenly, Lotus appears from behind and is already attacking Vangeance when Yami steps between them and blocks his attack. \nLotus recognizes Yami because he's fought him in the past but Yami fails to recognize him. Yami asks Lotus to surrender but instead Lotus retreats. Yami asks Vangeance if they can have a little chat now that they're alone. Yami tells him that he's going with his gut instincts and asks Vangeance to take off his mask. He believes that underneath is Licht.\n", "A clearly concerned Yuno asks Asta if his arm is okay. Asta says that it is fine. He points out that Yuno has gotten taller and wonders how he grows so easily. Sylph is jealous because of the way Yuno is acting towards Asta. Asta asks who she is but Sylph is more worried about who Asta is. Yuno explains that he used to live, study, and sleep with Asta. Charmy Pappitson appears before Yuno and holds out what looks like a cake. He accepts the treat and begins to eat it. Sylph gets jealous but believes that Charmy is not a threat. Because Yuno saved Charmy, Sylph gets jealous and begins to pull Charmy's hair. They get into a fight over Yuno. Asta and Yuno both tell them to stop but they do not listen. \nFinral Roulacase is introduced to Yuno. Langris Vaude arrives and asks what Finral is doing here since he is weak and does not know how to fight. Asta asks who he is and Finral tells him that Langris is his little brother. Langris proceeds to make fun of Finral but Asta is not having it. He stands up for Finral and even tells Langris about how he helped them win back at the Underwater Temple. Finral tells Asta that it is okay because Langris is only telling the truth. Langris tells them that they have got the fighting covered and that the Black Bull squad is not needed here. He also insults both Charmy and Asta's sizes. This is the last straw and Finral finally stands up to Langris and tells him to not make fun of his teammates. \nSuddenly, a wad of slime is thrown at Langris but he takes care of it. A large, slime monster begins to approach them. Yagos survived Langris's attack but now carries a bunch of civilians trapped within his slime. This makes it impossible for them to attack him without injuring innocent people. Langris is willing to sacrifice them but Asta is not. Asta decides that he will save them with the help of Charmy and Finral. Asta is thrown at the slime monster by bouncing off a fluffy sheep and Finral uses his Spatial Magic to transport him to where he needs to be. Asta reappears with his Demon-Slayer Sword in his mouth and cuts through Yagos's magic. He hits Yagos once more with the sword and Yagos is thrown against a wall. The townspeople fall to the ground and so does Asta but Yuno saves him with his Wind Magic. \nMeanwhile, Yami Sukehiro and William Vangeance are still up on the tree and Yami is waiting for William to remove his mask. William warns him that his face is not one people want to see. Yami promises not to laugh. William points out that Yami just wants him to remove his mask because he suspects that William is the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun. Yami does not deny it because they way they move and his ki are similar. William finally agrees to remove his mask, revealing a huge scar on the upper half of his face. Yami asks if he got on the battlefield but William says that he was born like that. He tells him that he is a bastard son of a noble and was taken in by a noble family after their heir died. They marveled at his magic but still feared his face. His stepmother abused him because of it. \nHe tells him that then he met Julius Novachrono who was awed by his magic and encouraged him to join the Magic Knights. William wanted to but he was worried about how they would react to his face. So Julius made him a mask. Yami finally realizes that William is not Licht and apologizes for making him take off his mask. William tells him not to worry because it was nice to share his story with someone. William gets a call about the retreating Diamond Kingdom army and he tells them not to pursue them. Instead, he asks that they focus on helping the injured. Yami tells him that he brought some help and that they can use them too. \nFinral decides that they should go find Yami so he creates a portal and the three of them step through it. Asta willingly but Charmy fights as she vows to catch Sylph and fry her. Finral is upset because they just picked a fight with Golden Dawn. Charmy hands him some food and tells him to eat. Langris warns Yuno about who he associates himself with. He wonders if Yuno is embarrassed by Asta. Yuno says no, that he is proud of Asta and that he is his rival to become the Magic Emperor. Langris continues to make fun of Yuno's dream but Yuno tells him that first he will become the captain of Golden Dawn. Klaus comes to tell them that the fight is over but the two walk in opposite directions.\nMarx Francois reports to Julius and tells him that it has all been taken care of. Julius wonders what the Diamond Kingdom was after. Back in the Diamond Kingdom, Lotus reports to a shadowed figure.\n", "Yami Sukehiro takes Asta to Owen to be looked at. Yami leaves Asta with Owen and leaves to go gambling. While Owen is healing him, he discovers something and tells Asta. Finral Roulacase, having been looking for Asta, overhears it. After, Finral and Asta wait for Yami to arrive so that they can head back to the Black Bull base. Yami arrives carrying a big bag but will not tell them what is in it. Finral opens a portal and the three of them return home. Back at the base, Yami tells the team that they have finally gotten out of the negative when it comes to earning stars. He rewards them by giving them meat to eat. The group devours the meat. Yami asks them to each perform a special trick. Finral punches himself using Spatial Magic, Charmy Pappitson makes meat disappear, Grey transforms herself, Luck Voltia puts Magna Swing in a lightning tornado, and Asta says that he will work out, although they do not think that is a trick.\nAsta decides to call it a night and heads to his room. Magna and Noelle Silva are worried because it is unlike Asta to get tired. Finral reveals to the group what he overheard. Owen had told Asta that his arms would never be the same again. It is because a curse was placed on them and his bones are shattered. Vanessa Enoteca cannot believe it. Asta does not have any magic and now he cannot even use his only weapon. Instead of going to his room, Asta sits on a rock in a field. Everyone is hiding behind the trees watching him. Suddenly, Asta stands up and yells that he is not going to give up. That he will find some kind of way to fight. Everyone is relieved and proud of Asta for not giving up. Vanessa wonders if magic from a certain country could help Asta heal.\nThe next day, Asta goes into the living room but finds no one there except for Yami. Asta wonders where everyone could have gone to. He senses someone's ki so he follows it to find Noelle and Finral talking. Finral has just finished sending the team to different places. Their excuses were that something came up but he knows that they are all looking for a cure for Asta. Asta overhears this. Magna and Luck went to search a dungeon in the Forsaken Realm. Gauche and Gordon are researching hexes in the royal library. Charmy and Grey went searching for some unknown ingredients that might work against curses. He also overhears both Finral and Noelle calling him a no-magic peasant. But then both of them say that despite having no magic he is still the first one out in the field. Noelle says that it is their turn to help him. \nAsta walks away and heads outside. He looks to the sky and begins to cry. He realizes that he was not blessed with magic but that he was blessed with great friends. Noelle asks Finral to take her some place. He agrees but wonders where Vanessa ran off to. Finral opens a portal and the both of them step through. They arrive before a shack. Noelle knocks and the door is answered by a naked man. Noelle blasts water at him and he falls to the ground.\n", "Noelle Silva and Finral Roulacase go to visit Fanzell Kruger.\nFive months prior, before Asta and Yuno leave to take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam, Asta is camping out in the forest near Hage training with his sword. Suddenly, a naked Fanzell comes running towards him as he is being chased by a boar. Asta tells Fanzell to jump out of the way and hits the boar with his sword. It sends the boar flying and Fanzell thanks Asta for his help. Fanzell introduces himself but tells Asta to call him Zell. Fanzell's stomach starts to growl so Asta gives him some tatoes. Asta asks Fanzell why he is naked and Fanzell tells him it is because he did not want to get his clothes wet while he was fishing. Fanzell invites Asta back to the house he is staying at. Fanzell puts on some clothes and Asta explains to him why he is out in the woods. Asta asks Fanzell why he is out here and Fanzell tells him that he is waiting for someone. Fanzell invites Asta to stay with him while he trains. Asta accepts despite his conscience telling him to learn more about Fanzell first.\nThe next morning, Asta is training outside but is having trouble. Fanzell gives him a few pointers. This works and helps to improve Asta's stance. Asta asks Fanzell if he has a sword too and Fanzell displays his Slicing Wind Emperor spell. Asta asks Fanzell to show him how to use a sword. Fanzell agrees but asks Asta to promise that he will only use anything that he shows him to make his dream come true and that he will not use it to harm the weak or innocent. Asta promises.\nA few days later, Asta and Fanzell train together. At dinner that night, Asta points out that Fanzell could have taken care of the boar on his own. Fanzell tells him that he did not have his grimoire so he could not have. Asta tells Fanzell that he is a great teacher. Fanzell tells Asta that he has taught over a hundred students but that Asta may be in his top two.\nThe next few days pass and suddenly a woman named Mariella arrives. Fanzell explains that she is one of his students and that she has been helping him look for his fianc\u00e9e. Asta asks why Fanzell has not but Fanzell says that he cannot do anything that will bring too much attention. Asta introduces himself to Mariella and the two of them get into an argument over Asta calling Fanzell \"old guy.\" Fanzell tells them to quit it and asks Mariella where Domina is. Mariella tells Fanzell that she may have passed away. Fanzell explains to Asta that he and Dominate used to belong to the Diamond Kingdom army. They could not take how cruel the army was being so they tried to escape but got separated. He had Mariella look for her while he waited at the house so as not to draw attention to the assassins chasing after them. Mariella hands over Domina's wand to Fanzell and tells him that she also found a lot of blood. Fanzell asks to be left alone.\nLater, Mariella attacks Fanzell and tells him that she killed the other students he set free and that her new job is to gather information and eliminate any defectors. She tells him that she is not going to kill him though because she was ordered to bring him back alive. She mentions that another warrior is ready for his teachings back at the Diamond Kingdom. Fanzell says that his name is Mars and that he is not some kind of weapon. Asta breaks down the door and arrives to help. Mariella tells him to stay out of the way because she does not want him to die for Fanzell. Fanzell agrees because Asta does not really know him and that he can take care of these guys on his own. Asta tells him that he does know him and that Fanzell has been stabbed so how can he fight.\nAsta leaves but then runs back in and swings his sword at the other Diamond guards. Fanzell tells him that it is okay because he has lost the will to live. Asta tells him that he needs to find a new reason to live because they are not just handed to him. He continues to fight the Diamond assassins, and Fanzell, finally, joins in. They stand back to back as they face the assassins but Mariella surprisingly sounds a retreat. Mariella tells Fanzell that she will hunt him for the rest of his life. Fanzell tells her to bring it on because he is done running. Mariella tells him to do his best and leaves.\nAsta and Fanzell part ways. Fanzell tells Asta that he is going to go look for Domina because he is sure that she is alive. Fanzell tells Asta to get going because he has all the tools he needs to get what he wants done. They say goodbye and Asta turns to return to his village. Suddenly, he hears screams and turns back to find Fanzell running towards him with a boar on his tail. He is naked again. Fanzell tells Asta that his last lesson is to defeat this boar but Asta tells him to do it himself.\n", "Noelle Silva is outside gathering herbs when Fanzell Kruger approaches her naked. Noelle freaks out thinking that he is a pervert and sends water flying at him. Noelle runs back to the Black Bull base and Fanzell is apprehended by the squad. They are ready to turn him over to Magic Knight Headquarters when Asta arrives. He recognizes Fanzell and the gang releases him with their apologies. Asta asks Fanzell what he is doing here. Fanzell tells Noelle that he is pretty sure that the wand she is using was created by his fianc\u00e9e. Noelle says that the person who gave it to her was named Code and Fanzell says that her full name is Dominante Code. He asks where she got it and she tells him the black market in the capital city. He starts to break down and Asta is excited because he will be finally reunited with Domina. Fanzell thanks Noelle profusely and Vanessa Enoteca tells Fanzell that she can lead him to the market. Yami Sukehiro tells Finral Roulacase to use his magic to take them where they need to go. Asta and Fanzell are saying goodbye again when suddenly the base comes under attack.\nMariella and Galleo watch from a distance. Galleo instructs his squads to move closer. Mariella asks Galleo to use his Spatial Magic to get her closer. Galleo instructs the squads to attack but before they do a water barrier erupts around the Black Bull Squad base. Fanzell jumps out from within with Luck Voltia and Magna Swing on his tail. Luck and Magna attack the Diamond Kingdom assassins and bring them down. Gauche Adlai goes after Galleo and hits him with his Mirror Magic. Yami joins in on the fight and tells the others to leave some of the assassins for him. Fanzell sneaks up on Galleo and puts him in a headlock. Galleo tells him that he cannot hurt him because they have a hostage: Domina. Fanzell tells him that some of his teammates have already left to go find Domina. Galleo asks who he is and Fanzell transforms into Grey. \nMeanwhile, Fanzell reunites with Domina. Domina punches him and yells at him for taking so long in finding her before she embraces him. Domina thanks Noelle for leading Fanzell in the right direction. She also recognizes Asta and Asta asks how she knows him when Mariella appears. Fanzell jumps in front of Domina but Mariella says that she is not going to attack them. She used them to take care of the squads that Galleo was leading. While they were fighting, she headed to the black market to tell Domina about how Fanzell was coming. She hands them a map with an escape route mapped out for them to use. Asta asks why she is helping them. She tells them that this is her revenge against the organization. She would enact her plan then present herself to Clover Kingdom Magic Knights so that she would not be on the run like Fanzell and Domina.\nFanzell asks if she is sure her plan will work and Mariella says that she is content with accepting anything other than death. She asks Asta if he remembers telling Fanzell to find a reason to live for himself. Asta says yes. Mariella says that those words really resonated with her and that the punishment she will receive from all of this will allow her to restart and atone for everything that she has done. Suddenly, Galleo appears. Mariella tells everyone to run just as Galleo uses his magic on them. Fanzell and Asta jump in front of Mariella and the three of them are transported into Galleo's Unopening Red Room, where he creates Crevice Men to attack. Mariella asks Asta why he jumped in front of her. Asta says that when there is someone in need he can help them out as much as he wants. He and Fanzell begin to attack the magic soldiers.\nBack at Black Bull's base, Yami calls Magic Knight Headquarters and tells them to come pick up the assassins that they captured. Gauche cannot believe that Fanzell had that many people after him. Yami suddenly remembers that he met Fanzell once before during a battle against the Diamond Kingdom. He realizes that Fanzell must have defected and was being pursued because of that. Yami tells Gauche not to tell anyone that they aided a fugitive.\nLater, Fanzell and Domina say goodbye to Asta and the gang. They have decided to take Mariella with them. Noelle tells her that she needs to realize that when other people care about her, her problems become their problems too. So she has to think about that. Asta tells them to get going and for Fanzell to make Domina happy. Asta and Fanzell say goodbye but not before Fanzell asks to borrow some money.\nIn the present, Finral and Noelle have gone to visit Fanzell in search of a way to heal Asta's arms. Domina mentions the Witches' Forest. Meanwhile, Vanessa has arrived at the entrance to the Witches' Forest. She demands to be let in and the gates open and swallow her.\n", "Noelle Silva asks Dominante Code what the Witches' Forest is. Domina explains that the Witches' Forest is where skilled witches specializing in curses and familiars live. Finral Roulacase wonders if that is why Vanessa Enoteca disappeared so that she could get the Witch Queen to fix Asta's arms. Domina tells them that there is a rule stating that witches can only live in the forest and that Vanessa and Domina are essentially fugitives. Domina says that if Vanessa went back that she is worried because Vanessa was very important to the queen. Domina believes that if the rumors are true, then Vanessa may never be able to leave the Witches' Forest again. She tells them that the queen is powerful and unreasonable. She also warns them that if they go to the forest and anger the queen they probably will not come back alive. Noelle asks how to get there because they are going to go if there is a slight chance that there might be a clue to healing Asta's arms. Domina, Fanzell Kruger, and Mariella agree to go along with them.\nAsta is training outside when Noelle, Finral, Fanzell, Domina, and Mariella appear. Fanzell picks up Asta using his Wind Magic and they fly off towards the Witches' Forest. Vanessa stands in front of the Witch Queen and demands to be taught ancient dispelling magic. Meanwhile, Domina and the gang are trying to figure out how to get through the forest undetected. Domina presents them with cloaks that will hide their presence. With a confused Asta, they find a way into the forest. Meanwhile, Fana learns that the Black Bulls are up to something. She says that she will make them pay for hurting Licht and taking Vetto's life.\nUnderneath the cloaks, the group is able to sneak by witches undetected. Finral almost gives them away when he learns about love potions and yells out. Luckily, Fanzell quickly covers his mouth. As they fly, they pass by Security Golems. The girls pass undetected but the boys' cloak accidentally gets pulled off by a tree branch. The golems start to attack, and both teams fly away quickly through the air to avoid them. Finral uses his Spatial Magic to get them far away but stops occasionally to hand out his card with his contact information on it. They finally make it to the queen's palace.\nWhen they arrive, they find the Witch Queen standing over Vanessa. Asta tells her to get away from her and the queen tells him that she is just disciplining one of her children and that she is free to do whatever she wants to her daughters. Asta runs at her and with the help of Finral's magic attacks. The queen is fast and holds him off with a flock of birds. She realizes that he does not have any magic and that he is the boy whom Vanessa wanted to help. She tells them that Vanessa promised to be her slave if she healed Asta's arms. Asta realizes that everyone is there because they are concerned about him. Mariella distracts the queen so that Fanzell could save Asta. Asta tells the queen that Vanessa is one of them. The queen shows them their fate if they continue to attack her.\nSuddenly, she senses an army approaching the forest. She looks in her crystal ball and sees the Eye of the Midnight Sun with Fana leading the army.\n", "Witch Queen shows Asta, Finral Roulacase, Fanzell Kruger, Dominante Code, Mariella, and Noelle Silva the divination of the Eye of the Midnight Sun approaching the Witches' Forest. They recognize Fana right away. They are worried that she will be stronger than Vetto. Shidan tells Fana that part of the Black Bulls are there and that there is a magic stone hidden in the forest. Fana says that she will destroy them all and take the stone for herself. Fana has Salamander set the forest ablaze. The Witch Queen gets another divination and sees that the Diamond Kingdom is also attacking. Ladros asks Mars why he was summoned and Mars tells him that they are going to capture the Witch Queen during the chaos of the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack. Asta recognizes Mars and is thankful that he is alive, much to Finral's chagrin. Fanzell recognizes Mars as well. Asta says that he is going to defeat both the Diamond Kingdom and the Eye of the Midnight Sun. Noelle asks how he is going to do that without any arms. Asta realizes that she is right having forgotten that he was injured.\nVanessa Enoteca wakes up and asks what they are all doing there. Domina tells her that they were also looking for a way to heal Asta's arms. Vanessa tells Asta that she will convince the Witch Queen to help him. Asta declines saying that he cannot let her exchange her freedom for him. He tells her that he still has his last resort and removes the bandages from his arms. He pulls out the Demon-Dweller Sword and hits his arm with it hoping to negate the magic. In reality, he just injures himself more. Vanessa tells him that his friends are not there to be sacrificed. They are there to help him with a fate he cannot defeat on his own. She tells him that she was going to let the queen heal his arms and then use his Anti Magic to get them out of here. Noelle asks the queen if she is going to heal his arms since it looks like her forest is in a lot of trouble. Noelle tells her that if she does heal his arms, his friends will all defend her forest.\nThe Witch Queen agrees to heal his arms. She uses her Blood Magic to remove the curse and to heal and strengthen his arms. Asta is so excited and happy and prepares to fight both armies. Vanessa, Finral, and Noelle punch Asta for being so reckless, while Fanzell, Domina and Mariella watch. The Witch Queen tells them that she has fulfilled her end of the bargain. Asta says that he will fulfill his. Fanzell tells him to leave the Diamond Kingdom to them because he has some unfinished business with Ladros and Mars. Asta tells Fanzell not to die.\nMeanwhile, the witches outside watch as a large Security Golem attacks the Eye of the Midnight Sun. Fana uses her magic to destroy it. Shidan sends his men to capture witches to enslave them but Asta saves them. One of the witches scratches his face because she believes that witches are superior to men. Noelle puts out fires while Finral rescues the witches and Vanessa and Asta attack the terrorists.\nFanzell, Domina and Mariella go to face the Diamond Kingdom even though they are vastly outnumbered. Domina suggests that they split up so that they have a better chance at winning.\nAsta asks Vanessa to send him up into the air using her Thread Magic. Defeating the mages and using them as stepping stones, Asta works his way up to Shidan. After the others are defeated, Fana arrives and tells Asta that she will kill him for killing Vetto. She sends a ball of fire at him which he reflects back at her. Salamander counters with another fireball. The resulting explosion sends Asta falling through the air but Finral uses his Spatial Magic to transport him to a web that Vanessa created.\nFana tells them that they keep getting in the way and that she is going to kill them once and for all. Asta tells her that he will just keep throwing her attacks right back at her.\n", "Asta tells the group that he is just going to keep sending Fana's attacks back to her over and over again. Fana vows to destroy them and sends an attack their way. Vanessa Enoteca sees the attack coming and pulls herself, Asta, and Finral Roulacase out of the way. Vanessa notes that Salamander is one of the strongest of the Four Great Spirits after its attack took out the trees behind them. She realizes that they are up against a spirit that matches the military power of an entire nation. Asta attacks Salamander and slashes it across its chest with his Anti Magic swords. He tells the group that Vetto was much faster and had better senses. Asta believes they can defeat Fana. Meanwhile, Noelle Silva is trying to put out the forest fire with her Water Magic, but the flames just keep coming back. She hopes that Asta and the others are okay.\nAsta tells Fana that they should sit down and talk this through much to the surprise of Finral and Vanessa. Asta asks her what exactly does she hate so much and why is she against the Clover Kingdom. Fana tells him to shut up and blasts him with fire again. Vanessa pulls him out of the way and Asta goes through one of Finral's portals. He appears above Fana and slashes down at her blocking her oncoming attack. He tells Fana that Vetto also hated them and asks if they can just understand each other.\nFana remembers when she was a child and was walking with Licht. She asked who the human is in front of them and Licht said that he is Licht's friend. The human talked to the elves about them working together and that they should do their best to live alongside each other. She remembers Licht getting married and his human wife getting pregnant with his child. He claimed that the child would bring the humans and elves together. The elves were attacked by humans, and an elf blamed Licht's friend because he was the only one that knew them.\nFana does not believe Asta and grows a third eye on her forehead. Suddenly, dark clouds surround the forest. Fana pushes Asta off of Salamander with her magic and Asta notices that she also has a third eye. As he falls, Salamander gets bigger. Vanessa says that it not only got bigger but is using magic with different attributes. Asta says that he will have to bring out his special move. Meanwhile, Mariella is leading the witches out of the forest to safety. Dominante Code is trying to think of a way to use a Security Golem.\nAsta, Finral and Vanessa are thrown back by the hot air that surrounds Fana. Asta asks if they are okay. Finral says yes but that he is having a hard time manipulating space and Vanessa says that her Thread Magic is getting burned. Fana goes to attack them but Noelle creates a Sea Dragon's Cradle around the group and protects them. Salamander attacks the sphere sending the group flying. Vanessa and Finral grab some tree branches and the group escapes on makeshift brooms. Noelle knows that she has to be the one to defeat Fana since she has Water Magic. She knows she can do it but she hears Solid's voice in her head telling her that she cannot. Suddenly, she hears Asta telling her that she is strong enough to do it. Vanessa turns the broom back towards Fana. Noelle knows that she can only use this attack once. Noelle sends Sea Dragon's Roar at Fana and it misses but then comes around and grabs Salamander. It holds it in its jaws until it explodes. Salamander begins to fall from the sky. \nAsta says that it is his turn and prepares to attack. Fana sends a familiar attack made of diamonds their way. Asta realizes that it is the same attack that Mars used. Asta asks Fana if she happens to have a brother and describes what Mars looks like. He tells her that her brother is on the other side of the forest. Fana says that she has no siblings besides Licht and the village people. He cannot get through to her so he decides that he has to use his special move before she recovers. Finral asks what this special move is. Asta describes it and both Vanessa and Finral say that they will help him with this move. Vanessa believes that with their help the move will become extremely powerful. They throw him in Fana's direction. He speeds through the air and misses the first time but Finral teleports him back and this time he manages to power through Salamander. Asta's Bull Thrust tears through Salamander. \nFana cannot believe what just happened. As she falls to the ground, she thinks of Licht.\n", "The Witch Queen watches through her orbs as Asta took down Fana. She realizes that he was not all talk. She looks to her other orb which is showing the Diamond Kingdom invading on the other side of the forest. Fanzell Kruger flies before the army. He tries to talk to Mars. Ladros recognizes him as their old teacher and is gleeful that he gets to attack Fanzell. He sends a blast of magic but Fanzell cuts it apart. Seeing that neither of his students are who they used to be, Fanzell asks if they have any intention of turning back. Ladros just laughs and says that that is his line, and explains that their king is really sick and that the Witch Queen has lived for hundreds of years. The king wants to know how that is possible even if he has to kill everyone in the forest. They heard that the Eye of the Midnight Sun was also attacking the forest and decided to take advantage of the chaos. Ladros says that taking what they want by force is the Diamond Kingdom way. Fanzell says that is exactly why he left. Fanzell flies at Ladros and Mars but rushes past them for the army behind them. He attacks multiple mages at once and is recognized by them as a traitor. One says that they should kill him and get the reward money. Fanzell notices that neither Ladros nor Mars take advantage and attack because it is hard to attack when your allies are all in one place. Fanzell says that there is only so much he can do and is counting on Dominante Code and Mariella for help.\nBelow, Mariella is sneaking in reinforcements and Domina is working on the Security Golems. Mariella and the witches attack. Mohawq wonders how they are able to predict their moves so easily. Mariella comes up behind him and tells him that it is because she used to be part of the Diamond Kingdom's assassination squad. She remembers when she used to kill people who were doing everything they could to survive. She tells the mage that this might not atone for what she has done but that she will put an end to their tyranny. She then freezes him to a tree. Domina summons the golems and they blast the mages in the sky. She tells another witch that she used magic tools and skills to modify the golems. Domina tells the witches that now is the time for them to teach the invaders a lesson for destroying their houses. She yells for them not to underestimate witches as she directs the witches on their attack. Ladros says that they set traps for them below the treeline but that it looks like fun so he dives right in. Fanzell predicted this and catches Ladros with whirlwinds. He asks Ladros again if there is a chance of him turning back. Ladros says no because he wants to kill lots and lots of people. Ladros points out that Fanzell was the one who trained them to be murderers and now he wants to live as a good person. Fanzell tells Ladros that he promised Asta that he is done running and that he wants to live. He slashes his sword at Ladros.\nFanzell reflects on his training of Ladros and Mars when they were youngsters. Fanzell realizes that his attack might not be enough to take out Ladros. He goes in for another but Mars yells for him to stop. Fanzell knows that he cannot beat Mars in close quarters combat so he uses Slicing Wind Emperor: Mountain Retreat to repel Mars. Fanzell turns back to Ladros and attacks with his strongest spell. Ladros does not have a magical attribute and always had a complex about that. Fanzell must take him out first just in case he has developed a powerful long-distance spell. Fanzell asks that Ladros forgive him. Suddenly, Ladros smiles because the magic has not harmed him. Instead, he has been absorbing Fanzell's magic. He tells Fanzell that he had the army surgically modify him and that he gained a certain magical ability: absorption and emission. He can absorb all the magical attacks on his body and fire them back whenever he wants. Ladros warns Fanzell that he should go save anyone that he brought with him into the forest. Fanzell turns to go search for Mariella and Domina. Ladros says that Fanzell can race his magic to them and releases Million Laser, which destroys everything in that section of the forest. He gets so worked up that he even kills some of his own mages. \nLadros finds Fanzell laying on the ground. He had thrown an air shield around Domina. Ladros kicks Fanzell before picking up Domina. He tells her that she recognizes her as the girlfriend with whom Fanzell defected. Fanzell tells Ladros that he should be using his powers to protect people. Ladros says that he did not go through special training for that. He says that using his power in battle is the best. He wants to be acknowledged and that is why he climbed up the ranks to the Eight Shining Generals. Ladros calls Fanzell a coward for having run away. Domina uses her wand to hit Ladros and claims that Fanzell is not a coward. Ladros says that he is going to have to get rid of Domina first. He throws her into the air and aims a magic blast at her. Before it can hit her, Mars blocks it with Laevateinn. He lands on the ground with Domina in his arms and tells Fanzell that his lessons got through to Mars, that he uses his power to protect people now.\nLadros asks Mars what he is doing, and Mars responds that their target is the Witch Queen and that they do not need to kill unnecessary people. Ladros says that Domina and Fanzell are enemies of the Diamond Kingdom and that to let them go is to betray their kingdom. Mars says that is what he is going to do then. Ladros celebrates because now he can finally kill Mars legally. Mariella sneaks up behind Ladros and fires multiples blades of ice into him. Ladros absorbs them and turns to attack her but Mars knocks Ladros into the air with a clump of crystals. Fanzell asks Mars why he is protecting them, to which Mars replies that he was not expecting to see Fanzell and that he is on Fanzell's side. He also says the details can wait but they have to do something about Ladros. Mars says that one way to defeat him would be to feed him so much magic that he self-destructs. The other method is Anti Magic. Fanzell says that Asta is on the other side of the forest and that they can lure Ladros over there, to which Mars agrees. Ladros comes after them but Mars and Fanzell slip behind him and use Reinforcement Magic to push him towards the other side of the forest.\nMeanwhile, Asta is telling Fana that they have her surrounded and that resistance is futile. He tells her that she is still young, that she should not throw her life away, and that her friends and parents will be disappointed if she does something stupid. Fana's third eye begins to glow and she tells Asta to not talk about her friends.\n", "Asta, Finral Roulacase, Noelle Silva, and Vanessa Enoteca have Fana surrounded. Above, Fanzell Kruger and Mars lead Ladros towards Asta but realize that he may have his hands full with Fana. Fanzell and Mars fly overhead just as the Salamander sends a fireball towards Asta. Fanzell tells Asta to deflect towards him. Asta does so and Fanzell aims the fireball towards Ladros. It engulfs him and he burns up before falling towards the forest. Fanzell and Mars land in front of Asta. Asta asks Fanzell why he is with Mars since he is the enemy. Fanzell says he will explain everything later but for now he asks Asta to trust Mars. Asta reluctantly agrees. They turn towards Fana and Mars realizes that her flames are similar to his. He gasps as he recognizes Fana.\nMars remembers when he was a child and how Fana used to cheer him up after tough training sessions. He also remembers how he and the other children were told to kill each other and that the winner would be the kingdom's mage warrior. Fana tried to kill him but Mars struck first. After, he was mourning when Fana reaches up and heals him. She told him to go see the world outside before she died. In the present, Mars yells out Fana's name and tries to go to her but is stopped by Asta. Fanzell recognizes her as well but says that he had heard she had died after having been experimented on by Moris. He wonders about the third eye she has on her forehead and believes that the Eye of the Midnight Sun is controlling her through it. Fana floats in the air and tells everyone that she hates them before she calls upon self-destruct magic.\nFana sends multiple blasts towards them. Asta deflects some, Noelle creates a water barrier, but Mars lets the blasts hit him. Fanzell tells him to block it with his magic but Mars says that he has no right to because he killed Fana. Asta hits him and tells him that now is not the time for that. He tells Mars that if Fana is so important to him that now is not the time for him to die. He tells him to live so that he can save her. Fanzell has faith that Mars will be able to save her. Vanessa believes that her Thread Magic and Finral's Spatial Magic are no match for Fana. Noelle concludes that Asta needs to be the one to stop her.\nAsta and Mars rush forward together. When they get closer, the heat from Fana's magic burns them, so Mars cloaks them in Phoenix Feathers Robe. As Asta walks forward, Mars is amazed by him. He has fought many other mages but he has never met anyone as stubborn as Asta. He believes that Asta is a true knight because he is always trying to protect people. Asta notices that Mars is not the same as when he fought him. Fanzell tells the others that they should evacuate because Fana could blow at any minute. Vanessa, Noelle, and Finral refuse to leave their friend behind. Fana tells them that it is over but Asta cuts through her magic with his sword.\nAsta thinks that it is over but Fana says it is not. Asta turns to face her but Mars runs past him and pulls Fana into a hug. Memories flash before Fana's eyes. Mars tells her that they must see the outside world together. The fire surrounding them surges but then disappears completely. Mars pulls back and Fana tells him that she promises to see the world with him. They embrace as Mars cries. Everyone else is relieved that it is over.\n", "Mars thanks Asta for helping him save Fana, which makes Fana happy since Mars had made a friend from outside their kingdom. Asta wonders what happened to her and Fana explains she barely remembers. After the final training, Moris was interested in her phoenix powers and experimented with her embedding a mage stone, but ended up disappointed as the experiment failed and she had hardly any magic left. He threw her away, but then Licht found and took her, needing her body to reincarnate an elf. Fana does not have any more memories after that and feels like someone else entered her body and controlled her.\nThe other thing that Fana recalls is a strong desire to get the magic stone. The group realizes there is a magic stone in the Witches' Forest and decide to find the Witch Queen; however, in that moment, they feel a magic presence and get attacked by Ladros. Fanzell Kruger is surprised that Ladros is standing as he did not have any magic left, but Ladros explains he emitted it all and then took it back, which took him a bit of time. Asta protects Mars and Fana and decides to take on Ladros, who guesses Asta is the Anti Magic Knight and states he was also born without any magic attribute and they made fun of his as a child, but mocks Asta for being even more worthless. Ladros offers Asta to join him, while secretly intending to take his Anti Magic for himself, but Asta refuses. Ladros then flies up and uses Million Laser, stating that he knows how Asta fights and that without Finral's power, Asta cannot do anything to him. Ladros tells him that there are two types of people: the users and the used, and explains how he used people to climb up the ladder and will use Mars and Fana to climb even more.\nSuddenly the Demon-Dweller Sword cuts through Ladros's magic and strikes him in the shoulder. Unable to remove the sword, Ladros falls to the ground while his magic is leaking. Angry, Asta states that he got to where he is now thanks to his friends and that they have boosted each other. Ladros begs for forgiveness and asks Asta to remove the sword, but Asta refuses and intends to knock him out. Using the little magic left, Ladros pushes himself up and, enforcing himself with magic, manages to pull out the sword. He heads to Fana and takes her hostage. He forces her to unleash Salamander or he will kill Mars. The moment she does, he gambles and absorbs the spirit. Successful, he obtains power greater than before. Ladros gets excited about his new powers, stating that the other Eight Shining Generals do not stand a chance and he could even take the Kingdom. He attacks Asta with a fast ranged beam, which Asta is unable to dodge. The Witch Queen watches from a distance and uses her Blood Magic to make Asta show her who he really is. Anti Magic then comes out and engulfs Asta's right hand.\n", "Asta wakes up in a weird space and wonders if he is dead. The Anti Magic Devil then appears and tells him he will be taking his body. Asta manages to dodge his attack and the devil tells him that if he takes his body, he will be able to win against Ladros. Asta refuses as he wants to take him down by his own strength. The devil tells him to give up as there are places he cannot reach; however, Asta still refuses and the devil engulfs his entire body.\nAsta faces Ladros with his right hand covered in black Anti Magic and growing a black wing. Asta and Ladros engage in a fight with Asta now being able to keep up with Ladros speed and blocking his attacks. He throws his sword, Ladros dodges it commenting he will not fall for the same trick, but in an instant Asta closes the distance and slashes him with his other sword. Ladros grabs Asta's head, thinking he cannot dodge now, but using raw strength, Asta throws him to the ground. Witch Queen comments she thought he would loose consciousness, but it seems Asta was able to control it. She explains that the Anti Magic constantly flows through the Anti Magic Weapons, draining the wielder's magic, and no one should be able to wield it, but as Asta does not have magic, the Anti Magic flows through him. He has been constantly emitting and shutting that power while fighting, but using the power of her blood, which she transfused while treating him, she accelerated the flow of power and removed the limits on its output, and he will become the Anti Magic vessel.\nLadros starts running and continues to use ranged attacks on Asta, but he is neither able to escape or do something to Asta. The Witch Queen states that a sudden mutation kept mana from dwelling in Asta, but that does not make him special; however, due to that, he is able to wield the sword and be special. Ladros releases a dragon beam attack, but Asta goes through it as his Anti Magic homes in on mana. Asta eventually reaches Ladros and slashes him using Black Meteorite.\nLadros falls defeated with all of his magic gone, and his mage stones break. Ladros wishes Asta to kill him, but Asta refuses stating that he will be going to rescue all the people he hurt and will be waiting for him to heal up and come help and apologize to them. Ladros starts to laugh and states he cannot beat \"that\". With the mage stones broken, his head now feels lighter. Ladros then guesses that people like Asta are able to climb to the top and if he was with him, they may have helped each other get stronger. The Anti Magic then dissipates from Asta's body and he feels great pain all over his body.\nThe Witch Queen appears and Asta tells her that they defeated the Eye of the Midnight Sun and Diamond Kingdom mages, so he paid back for fixing his arm. Even though it was not perfect, she did not need to fight and congratulates Asta. He asks her if she can heal everyone; however, the Witch Queen states this will not be necessary and unleashes her Blood Magic and captures everyone. Using her blood, she then controls Asta and makes him draw the Demon-Slayer Sword. As she needs him alive, she uses Curse-Breaking Blood Cocoon to heal Asta. The Witch Queen cannot hold the sword herself, that is why she wants Asta to hold it for her. She then orders Asta to kill everyone else.\n", "The Witch Queen decides to make Asta kill Noelle Silva first. The group tries to speak with Asta, but their words do not reach him. As he is about to slash Noelle, Asta manages to stop himself. The Witch Queen is surprised that even though he is unconscious, he still struggles. However, she easily manages to regain her control over him. Vanessa Enoteca begs the Witch Queen to stop him and promises she will never leave the forest or disobey her. The Witch Queen refuses, stating that she will kill them now and that will stop Vanessa from doing anything foolish in the future. She explains that her divinations told her that Vanessa would summon what she wants and return to the forest alive. Because of that, she did not search hard for her, but did not expect that she wanted a human with Anti Magic Weapons. The Witch Queen states Vanessa formed trivial bonds with imperfect fools that will only bring their death and that she cannot sever their bond as Vanessa is her daughter and family.\nVanessa recalls her past and how she was kept in a cage. She asked the Witch Queen for how long she must stay in the cage and stated that her Thread Magic do not have the incredible power the Queen had claimed. The Witch Queen told her that one day she would be able to control destiny and she would stay in there until she invoked that magic. As time passed, Vanessa considered escaping but did not believe she could disobey the Queen. One day, she heard a commotion outside, and suddenly, Yami Sukehiro into broke her cage. He had been training in the forest and was being chased for being a guy. When he asked what she was doing there, Vanessa stated she was locked away by the Queen and cannot leave as she was fated to be there. Yami stated that he hates fate and will do what he wants even if he has to crush fate. However, he decided to leave since he could not defeat the Queen. Vanessa wondered what she must do, so Yami told her that she must choose for herself. She chose to escape and joined Yami in the Black Bulls.\nVanessa tells the Queen that her family is the Black Bulls. Wishing to save her family, she cries wanting to use the power to change destiny and save them. Suddenly her grimoire creates a new magic, Red Thread of Fate, which takes the form of a cat made from red threads. Realizing she invoked the Red Thread of Fate, the Witch Queen decides to test it. She makes Asta kill Noelle, but the cat touches Asta. He still swings and slashes her. Thinking it is still incomplete, the Witch Queen catches herself saying the same thing and this time Asta slashes and cuts Noelle's cross down. Asta is about to stab Noelle, but the cat touches him again and he misses. Surprised, the Witch Queen decides to attack Finral Roulacase, but the cat again touches Asta and he does not kill Finral. She then decides to attack the cat, but Asta's slash goes through the cat, who then touches Asta and he hits himself with the Demon-Slayer Sword, which ends up undoing her control on him. The Witch Queen realizes how the cat works by touch and that it is harmless and unavoidable. Happy that Vanessa has awakened her true power, the Witch Queen attempts to take control of Vanessa and threatens to kill Vanessa's companions herself. However, the cat jumps and touches her and undoes her Blood Magic. Vanessa tells the Queen that she does not know much about her new magic, but she knows the magic takes her side and that of her family bond and there is no bond between Vanessa and the Witch Queen.\n", "Vanessa Enoteca tells the Witch Queen that there is no bond between them, and the queen recalls back to when Vanessa was a child and she wanted to make everyone smile with her Thread Magic. The Queen realizes she was too obsessed with perfection and had forgotten something important. Since Vanessa is imperfect, she can obtain power from her feelings. Because she was free and imperfect, she became perfect, and could obtain magic she could not while under the Queen's care. The Witch Queen then stands up and admits defeat, telling Vanessa that she is free to do as she pleases. Using Blood Recovery Magic, she heals everyone. Everyone is happy they won and Noelle Silva thanks Vanessa, stating they won because of her; however, Vanessa states it is thanks to everyone as they were there for her. While the Queen walks away, Nero lands on her shoulder and pecks her earring, making her wonder about the bird.\nLater, Fanzell Kruger asks the Witch Queen if she knows about the magic stone that the Eye of the Midnight Sun were after. The Witch Queen reveals it must be the stone on her earring and takes it off and hands it to them. Asta asks the Queen what is the stone and if she knows something about Eye of the Midnight Sun. The Witch Queen explains the stone heightens the wearer's powers, but only the Elf Tribe are truly able to use it. The elves possessed great power and lived in the Forsaken Realm several centuries ago. Even though they had great power, they were outnumbered and annihilated by the humans. The Queen explains that Fana's third eye is a forbidden spell that someone else put on her as it requires tremendous amount of mana and some sort of sacrifice. She also tells them that the ancient demon was a top-level forbidden spell activated by the leader of the elf clan. She theorizes that the Eye of the Midnight Sun may be descendants of the elves. Furthermore, she tells Asta that the two swords he uses are the ruined remains of the magic swords used by the elves' leader, and Asta loses consciousnesses as he cannot take in any more information.\nOutside, Mars and Ladros are heading back to the Diamond Kingdom. Mars reveals the Witch Queen gave him medicine with Puppet Bloodflow and he will pass it to the king as a longevity drug, and put an end to Moris's plans. Mars then intends to remake the Diamond Kingdom into a peaceful nation. Ladros decides to help Mars as that is also the quickest way to get into the top ranks of the Diamond Kingdom. Fanzell says they will look after Fana. Mars tells Fana to wait a little longer until he makes the country safe for her to return. Fana hugs him and states she will wait. Mars tells Asta that if he is ever in trouble, he will come to his aid and Asta tells him he will do that same.\nThe Witch Queen tells Vanessa that she is free, but that this is still her homeland and she can come visit anytime she wants. The group then returns to the Black Bulls base, where Asta tells Yami Sukehiro that his arms are healed, but there is not much of a reaction from Yami. Asta reveals they also got a magic stone, which excites Yami and tells Asta to go get some booze. Returning with the booze, Asta wonders about his next mission, but Yami tells him to rest for a bit. Disappointed, Asta hears Magna Swing's voice and realizes Magna and Luck Voltia are back. They went to a dungeon in order to find a way to heal Asta's arms. Asta and Noelle are shocked to see how different Magna and Luck look. Magna starts explaining they went to a dungeon, but in the end they were unable to find a heal magic for Asta's arms. Asta reveals his arms are already healed, and Magna and Luck immediately turn to normal and are happy for him. Gauche Adlai and Gordon Agrippa are also back from their mission to the royal library to look for a way to fix Asta's arms. Both Gauche and Gordon now look like nerds and promise Asta that one day they will find a way to fix his arms. When Asta reveals his arms a fixed, Gauche and Gordon return to normal and are annoyed as they told him they will fix it one day and want his arms to get cursed again. Gauche's nose bleeds, but he states it is from anger. However, Gordon knows that his nose only bleeds when he wishes really hard for someone important to him to be happy. Charmy Pappitson and Grey return covered in mushrooms. Charmy explains she got infested with magic mushroom parasites, but she cannot stop eating the mushrooms. Charmy reveals she got plenty of tasty things, but could not find a way to fix his arms. Since they have enough food and booze, Yami decides to hold a party. During it, Yami recalls no one was around in the morning and no one fed the beasts, did the laundry, or cleaned, and Asta happily heads to do the chores.\n", "While reading the reports, Yuno, Mimosa Vermillion, and Klaus Lunettes comment that they heard the Witch Queen healed Asta's arms. Mimosa is happy, but acts like she was not worried. Yuno and Klaus state the same, but Mimosa reveals she saw Klaus dumping water over himself each night and praying for Asta. She was going there to pray as well, but realizing she will reveal she was worried, Mimosa then states she actually did not see anything.\nKlaus reveals he called Yuno and Mimosa because of Eye of the Midnight Sun, who tried to take the magic stone located in the Witches' Forest, but Asta and the rest managed to stop them and take the magic stone. They are going to have a study session and Klaus asks Yuno what he knows about Eye of the Midnight Sun. Yuno recalls how the Eye of the Midnight Sun attacked the Royal Capital and how the Magic Knights fought them. However, they initially did not realize their true objective was Crimson Lion's captain, Fuegoleon Vermillion's pendant, who ended up severely injured as they took the pendant.\nKlaus then reads the reports of how Asta and the rest met Eye of the Midnight Sun near Nairn, and how other Magic Knight captains fought the Eye of the Midnight Sun strongest trio Third Eye. Seeing Asta using the Demon-Slayer Sword and Demon-Dweller Sword, the Eye of the Midnight Sun leader gets angry, but the Third Eye stop him and retreat. After some investigation, they realized that Fuegoleon's pendant had a Magic stone and that the Eye of the Midnight Sun wants to collect them, believing that with them they can be reborn in their true forms. Three more stones were left and they knew that one is located in the Seabed Temple, so the Magic Emperor assigned the Black Bulls to go and take it. Soon after arriving at the Seabed Temple, the Black Bulls faced one of the Third Eye, Vetto. They have managed to defeat him and obtain the magic stone located there and complete their mission.\nKlaus then reads the report about the Witch Queen, who explains the stone heightens the wearer's powers, but only the elf tribe are truly able to use it. She theorizes that the Eye of the Midnight Sun may be descendants of the elves and Asta's two swords are the ruined remains of the magic swords used by the elves' leader. Klaus does not know what will happen if they collect the magic stones, but as Magic Knights, they will defend the Clover Kingdom.\nYami Sukehiro hands the magic stone to the Magic Emperor, who praises the Black Bulls for their excellent job and managing to defeat the Diamond Kingdom's forces and the Eye of the Midnight Sun. Yami states they need stars, like a lot of them. The Magic Emperor avoids the stars conversation and tells Yami that they managed to find the Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout and it seems they are about to make a move. \n\n", "Yami Sukehiro informs the Black Bulls that the Star Awards Festival is coming. Finral Roulacase explains that the Magic Knights compete each year to see who can earn more stars and they announce the winner and top squad during the festival. Noelle Silva comments they are usually fighting for last place, but Yami corrects her stating they are dead last without any contest as the many troubles they cause make them the only squad with negative stars.\nAt the festival, the squad splits and do various activities they like. Noelle decides to stick with Asta, so he does not get lost. Kahono and Kiato join them, revealing that Asta asked Finral to bring them. Kiato sees Kahono looking at a musician and realizes she really wants to be able to sing again, while he would love to dance again. Asta asks him if he brought his leg with him and Kiato confirms. Asta opens a medicine which he took from the Witch Queen and her blood heals Kiato's leg and Kahono's throat. They cannot believe this is true and thank Asta and Noelle. Kahono immediately sings a song that mesmerizes the people around her and they applaud her after the song.\nMagna Swing comes with a cannon and wants Asta to help him shoot the fireworks, but seeing Asta is with a boy and two girls, he guesses it is a double date. Embarrassed, Noelle blasts him with her Water Magic. Seeing Noelle still having troubles with being honest, Kahono decides to make it a double date, causing Noelle to wonder if Kahono likes Asta, while Kiato thinks she is doing to help him with Noelle. Kahono intends to make Noelle jealous and fight and win Asta. They go and do variety of events, where Asta and Kahono enjoy their time, while Noelle only gets frustrated and jealous.\nSeeing Noelle does not do anything, Kahono decides to take them to a scare house, hoping that feeling scared Asta and Noelle will get closer. Sekke Bronzazza asks Aphro and Phati who work at the scare house to scare people, so that he can come out and save the girl, which will eventually lead in he finding himself a woman. The two try to scare Asta and Noelle; however, Noelle panics and starts blasting them with her magic, while Asta confuses them for the zombies during the Eye of the Midnight Sun attack, attacks them, and mistakes Sekke for their boss.\nAfter getting kicked out of the scare house, Kahono realizes Asta is too dense too and asks him what Noelle means to him. Before he answers, they see a crying child and Asta hears people complaining about it as it must be a peasant's child. Noelle approaches the child and wonders what is wrong, but the child continues to cry. Asta takes some balls and starts doing tricks. Seeing the child calming, Kahono starts singing about the Superman Asta, who does not have magic but can slash through any spell and Kiato joins her and starts dancing. The child calms down and reveal her name is Emma. Noelle asks Kahono to broadcast Emma's name to her parents using her Song Magic. Soon her mother shows up and thanks them. She sees that Noelle is a royal and apologizes. Noelle confirms she is royal and has strong magic, but because of that they must help others and not be arrogant and look down on others. She tells Emma to enjoy the festival as no matter of your status, everyone should enjoy it. Recalling Kahono's question, Asta states that he likes Noelle, which makes Noelle blush. Kahono expects Noelle to share her feelings, but instead Noelle blasts Asta away with her magic.\nAs Asta lands, he sees Yami and Jack the Ripper staring fiercely at each other and wonders what is going on.\n", "Noelle Silva wonders where Asta went after she blew him away with her Water Magic. Looking around, she sees a place with highly concentrated mana and sees Asta helping Yami Sukehiro sell his grilled squid, while Sekke Bronzazza and his friends Aphro and Phati help Jack the Ripper sell his meat dishes. Yami and Jack threaten Asta and Sekke to sell some food, but as no customers stop, Sekke complains its understandable considering how scary both captains are. Noelle asks Asta and Sekke what they are doing and both of them explain how Jack and Yami wanted to settle their score and decided a competition on which food stall will sell more and then Asta and Sekke were dragged into it.\nAsta sees a purple snake food stall and gets interested, however, Yami stops him and tells him how good his squids are. Yami and Jack blame Asta and Sekke for not selling anything and decide to settle it with their abilities. They start playing Dear or Alive, trying to make the person looking at the direction they point, then arm wrestling and thumb war. But as they end up in draws, they decide to actually fight. Since it will cause trouble, Yami tells Noelle to call Finral Roulacase and he transports them elsewhere. Secretly the Magic Knights disguised as an old woman follows them, excited to observe their fight and magic.\nYami and Jack start fighting and soon Yami decides to use his new technique that he developed and defeated Vetto. Seeing that, Asta and Noelle worry of what may happen and Noelle tells Finral to stop the fight and states it will be his fault if one of them gets injured, which will weaken the Clover Kingdom and Eye of the Midnight Sun or Diamond Kingdom may attack. Finral attempts to stop Yami, but ends up being kicked away. As Yami and Jack are about to unleash their magic, Julius Novachrono reveals himself and uses Chrono Stasis on everyone. Julius reveals that he would have loved to see Yami's new magic, but agrees with Asta that if one of them gets injured, it will put them to disadvantage against their enemies. Marx Francois contacts Julius and tells him to stop fooling around and come back as its time for the meeting concerning how many starts each squad earned. Before going back, Julius decides to make sure that Yami and Jack would not continue fighting and he unzips their pants. He leaves and releases the Chrono Stasis, leaving them wondering what happened. Yami and Jack find their pants being down funny and decide to stop fighting.\nThey return to their stalls, where Yami tastes Jack's food and Jack taste Yami's food. After liking each other's foods, Jack prepares a dessert for them. Yami agrees to call it a draw, and states he had 53 wins, 0 loses and 34 draws. Jack immediately disagrees, stating he has 98 wins, 0 loses and 1 draw. Yami then exaggerates with more wins and then Jack. As they started to argue again, they decide its time to settle their score with each other and prepare to fight again. Sekke and Asta try to stop the fight, but they only get thrown away.\nAfter landing elsewhere, Asta hears people talking about an attractive woman. He checks her out and agrees she is beautiful, but wonders from where he knows her.\n", "Baron Balmain notices the beautiful woman and decides she would be his companion for tonight; however, as she ignores him, he grabs her arm. Asta tries to go and stop him, but in an instant, the woman uses her magic and immobilizes Balmain. Seeing the Briar Magic, Asta realizes the woman is Charlotte Roselei, captain of the Blue Rose. Charlotte asks the man if he has any idea who she is and that she belongs to the Roselei House and he cannot use her as accessory just because she is a woman. Sol Marron comes with a dress and wants Charlotte to try it, but seeing Charlotte, she gets excited. Charlotte tells Balmain to try and use his magic to escape her briar. Asta wants to stop Charlotte from killing Balmain, but trips and lands on Sol's chest. Sol recognizes him and the two end up arguing about their sizes. As she tosses Asta aside, Sol takes Charlotte to try the dress she found, and while helping her dress, she gets excited about Charlotte's lovely and pale skin.\nEveryone is amazed at how Charlotte looks, but that only angers her and Sol, stating its not a show for them to watch. Charlotte does not want the other captains to see her like this, especially Yami Sukehiro, but hearing some commotion and Asta, Yami comes to see him. Charlotte panics, but keeps her composure outside and hopes that Yami does not recognize her, but he does and wonders why she is dressed like that. Charlotte asks him the same and Sol starts arguing with Yami to keep him away from Charlotte. Vanessa Enoteca suddenly appears and wants Yami to come and drink with her. She notices Charlotte and wonders who she is, but decides she cannot lose to her, while Charlotte gets jealous as Vanessa looks close to Yami. Vanessa challenges Charlotte who refuses since the ceremony is about to start; however, Sol accepts in her behalf.\nVanessa wonders what they challenge would be as she got quite strong recently. Finral Roulacase attempts to stop them since it is the festival and wants everyone to enjoy it, but they tell him to shut up. Finral then proposes a cosplay content. Charlotte finds it ridiculous, but after being mocked by Vanessa that she may lose, Sol agrees on Charlotte's behalf and states she looks great in any dress. Meanwhile, Klaus Lunettes, Yuno and Mimosa Vermillion pass by and see the commotion, but decide to continue towards the ceremony to not be late. Klaus is sure they will win, but comments that Black Bulls did good recently. The cosplay contest starts and Charlotte dresses as a witch and both wants Yami to look and not look at her. Vanessa then dresses as a sister, thinking to herself that Charlotte does not know anything about guys as they like things like this. Finral asks the audience to vote and the results ends up in a draw. Finral then suggests the second round to be in swimsuits; however, Charlotte uses her Briar Magic on him, stating that anyone who agrees with him will suffer the same fate and the audience quickly leaves.\nVanessa overhears a man promoting his Clover Beer and asks Yami if he likes girls who can drink and he confirms. Vanessa then challenges Charlotte to a drinking contest. Charlotte wants to refuse as the ceremony is coming, but Sol had already prepared the tables and drinks. Vanessa explains the rules and that the winner will be the one that drinks more in an hour. Charlotte thinks the match would be hard, since Vanessa is a heavy drinker, but suddenly sees Vanessa passed out as she had drunk too much before that. Charlotte then drinks, but she is a light drinker and instantly gets drunk and is unable to continue. Charlotte recalls how she was cursed and decided to become strong. She refused marriage proposal as if the men could not handle her magic, they would not be able to handle her curse. When she turned 18, her curse activated and her magic went wild. Yami then came cutting her magic and told her that he likes tough women, but it would not hurt to ask for help sometimes and the Magic Knights are full on strong people she can rely on. Her heart was stolen by Yami, which ended up breaking the curse. Yami grabs Charlotte's cup and drinks and reminds her that she should not push herself too hard. Charlotte sees this as indirect kiss and passes out. Finral announces its a draw, with Yami wondering what was the point of the battle besides waste of time.\nAsta sees the people start heading towards the hall as the ceremony is about to start and people being excited to see the new captains for the Crimson Lion and Purple Orca. Asta looks at Yami and Charlotte and Yami wonders what to do as they are late.\n", "Julius Novachrono steps out and announces that he will be announcing the squad achievements himself and after the achievements the King will appear as well. Julius reveals he considered not holding the festival as the Clover Kingdom was recently attacked by Diamond Kingdom, Spade Kingdom and the terrorist group Eye of the Midnight Sun. However, the Magic Knights protected the kingdom, he wanted to commend their courage. Julius then introduces each captain, as well as the new captains of the Crimson Lion and Purple Orca squads, Mereoleona Vermillion and Kaiser Granvorka. The audience notices that some captains are missing and Julius thinking to himself felt that Yami Sukehiro may be late, but did not expect it from Charlotte Roselei.\nJulius then announces the ranking with Golden Dawn taking first place with 125 stars, beating their record of 96 stars from last year. He introduces the Golden Dawn member who contributed the most stars, Yuno attended by Sylph, the Wind Spirit. People are expecting Crimson Lion to be second, but as Fuegoleon Vermillion got injured, they now expect Silver Eagle. The Black Bull members are messing around, expecting to be last again. Julius announces that the Black Bulls are second with 101 stars, shocking not only the audience, but the Black Bull members themselves. The people start wondering if they cheated and threatened someone, but Kiato, Kahono, and Rebecca Scarlet stand up for the Black Bulls, explaining that they risked their lives for them. Julius understands why people cannot believe it as last year the Black Bulls had -50 stars, but this year is different. He wants to introduce the Black Bulls newcomer who contributed the most stars, Yami then grabs Asta and throws him on stage.\nPeople wonder from what noble families Asta and Yuno are, but Sekke Bronzazza reveals they are peasants and Asta cannot even use magic. Hearing that, people cannot believe they used their abilities to rise up. Yuno tells Bell to use full power and shoots Wind Magic at Asta, who cuts it down with his sword. The people are surprised by Yuno's powerful magic and that Asta managed to stop it. Julius states there is no doubt about their achievements and how even though they are peasants, they have worked harder than anyone else, and everyone should overcome their differences in status and position, to unite and guide their kingdom to victory, which causes the crowd to agree and cheer. Julius continues and announces that the Silver Eagle are third with 95 stars, fourth are Blue Rose with 83 stars, fifth Crimson Lion with 76 stars, sixth Green Mantis with 69 stars, seventh Coral Peacock with 67 stars, eighth Purple Orca with 51 stars and ninth Aqua Deer with 49 stars. Rill is shocked to learn his squad is last and starts crying on Asta, wondering how the Black Bull got so many stars.\nJulius then calls forward King Augustus Kira Clover XIII, who while coming out expected loud cheers and people to revere him. As there are barely any cheers, he freaks and starts saying how great he is and they should cheer him as he is more important than the Magic Emperor. The crowd wishes the Magic Emperor to be king and a child actually says it out loud, causing everyone to turn towards it and shush it. Augustus is annoyed that Golden Dawn won again, beating squads who are led by royalty captains. He announces that the hideout of the Eye of the Midnight Sun has been found and he will be forming the Royal Knights, a group of elite Magic Knights to attack the hideout. A week from now, an exam will be held and all Magic Knights can participate and those who pass will join the Royal Knights. The Royal Knights is Julius's idea, but Augustus decides to take credit and gain some fame. Asta wonders why the King would be choosing them as Asta had never heard of him doing anything with his great mana. Angered, Augustus orders Asta and Yuno to be executed; however, Julius calms him down, asking him to spare them and that one day they may become a shield for him and this country. Julius reveals he is looking forward to the exam as well and that excites all of the Magic Knights.\nAsta apologizes to Julius for his words. Julius tells them that being a Royal Knights, they will have a chance to achieve great things, but they will face plenty of tough veterans on the exam. Asta and Yuno accept the challenge with Yuno stating that if they fail, they simply were not ready yet. Asta and Yuno then see Mereolona smacking Leopold Vermillion and yelling at Crimson Lion for taking fifth place and asking them if they want she to kill them now instead of waiting for a mission to do that.\n", "Asta and Yuno listen as Mereoleona Vermillion, the new captain of the Crimson Lions, berates her squad for placing fifth. She decides to force the squad to train at a hot spring. When she overhears Asta and Yuno talking, she grabs both of them and carries them on her way to collect additional Magic Knights in need of training.\nIn a bar, the other captains are having drinks, and Yami Sukehiro teases them that his squad placed second. Each time one of the captains gets aggravated, the bartender makes them a cocktail that calms them down. After Nozel Silva, Kaiser Granvorka, and Jack the Ripper leave, Mereoleona walks in to grab Yami and Charlotte Roselei. Sol Marron tries to stop Mereoleona from taking her captain, but Mereoleona lifts both of them. Noelle Silva comes in search of Asta so that he can say goodbye to Kahono and Kiato. Upon seeing Mereoleona, Noelle tries to walk away, but Mereoleona grabs her as well. Once everyone leaves, the bartender removes his disguise and reveals himself to be the Magic Emperor, Julius Novachrono.\nMereoleona carries them all to the Ultime-Volcano Mountain Trail, a volcanic Grand Magic Zone. She orders them to reach the summit by nightfall. Yami and Charlotte rush on ahead, demonstrating Mana Skin which defends against the area's extreme heat and chaotic mana. Noelle struggles to control her magic. Reminded of Acier Silva, Mereoleona approaches Noelle and offers her words of encouragement, which motivate her to not give up.\nElsewhere, Asta is lagging behind because his swords are useless against the heat. Mereoleona tells him to leave if he cannot climb the mountain. Asta stands back up and resolves to reach the summit.\n", "Asta figures he needs to active his newly obtained power to progress and attempts to clear his mind or even consider putting his life in danger to active it, but fails to do so. Thinking more about it, he recalls Mereoleona Vermillion's words that he does not know himself and how Yami Sukehiro thought him to use ki, and decides to use ki detection on himself. He sees his ki flow and something black flowing into him from the sword. He decides to strengthen that power by creating a ring of flow and grabs the blade of the sword with his other hand. As more Anti Magic flows into him, he manages to activate his black form, but then suddenly flies up. Leopold Vermillion and Noelle Silva face a magical lava beast, but see Asta fly through the beast. Asta continues to fly towards the mountain summit, passing Yuno on the way and then heading towards Mereoleona due to her enormous mana. He tells her to run; however, Mereoleona refuses and, using her Fire Magic, knocks Asta down.\nAfter the last of the Crimson Lions reach the summit, Mereoleona scolds them for being late as they had to reach it during the day and not during the night when the volcano becomes dormant. However, she allows them to use the hot springs and tells everyone to take off their clothes. Everyone starts to wonder if it is okay to do so as there are women with them. Charlotte Roselei starts to panic and gets excited that she will be with naked Yami in the hot spring; however, Sol Marron not wanting a man to see Charlotte's body uses Earth Magic and creates Mud Wall Partition to split the hot spring in two. She warns the men that if they climb the wall, they will die.\nWhile soaking in the hot spring, Mereoleona offers Charlotte a drink, but knowing she cannot handle alcohol and not wanting Yami to see her passed out, she refuses. Sylph, however, wishes to drink. Sol helps Noelle wash her hair and asks her to join their Magic Knights squad, but Noelle refuses as she is already in the Black Bulls. Sol comments that the Black Bulls are full of men, while in the Blue Roses, the males are only errand boys. Thinking about naked Yami, Charlotte passes out. Sylph also passes out as she cannot handle alcohol too. Mereoleona tells Noelle that her mother, Acier Silva, showed Mereoleona this hot spring and was a strong warrior, whom Mereoleona could never beat. Although Noelle looks so much like Acier, her sloppy magic abilities make it hard to believe she is Acier's daughter. Because of that, she must surpass Acier with her own strength. Noelle gets fired up, but also realizes the water has gotten hotter.\nOn the men's side, Leopold is heating the water, trying to make Yuno unable to handle the heat; however, Yuno states he is alright and even starts using Wind Magic to cool himself. Leopold finds that as cheating, but Yuno states that magic is his strength and that Leopold is also using magic to heat the water. Yami tells them there is a better way to spend time in the hot spring: peeping at the women's bath. He tells them that if they are true men, they will do it even if it costs them their lives. Yuno states he is not interested, which only annoys Yami, but Asta explains that Yuno is really not interested and has only bathed with men before. Leopold thinks of his brother, Fuegoleon Vermillion, and states he would not do that and even will try to stop them. Yami wonders if Leopold wants to be like Fuegoleon or surpass him. Yami inspires the men, who then start running towards the wall. The women hear their voices and realize they will try to peep. Sol wanting to protect Charlotte, creates even a bigger wall, but the men are not stopping and try to climb it. Yami tells Asta to go and peep, but Asta recalls Sister Lily and yells that his heart belongs to her and that he refuses to look, which shocks everyone.\n", "The vice-captain of Purple Orca, Xerx Lugner, returns to the Royal Capital, but a man stands in his way and provokes him. Xerx decides to use Ice Magic to make the man regret his words, but ends up utterly defeated by him, who then takes his Magic Knights robe, stating its being wasted on him and wonders if there is anyone else around worth humiliating.\nOn the arena, the Magic Knights start to gather and Asta greets Mimosa Vermillion and Klaus Lunettes. He tells Yuno that the hot springs were great and although he lost the volcano race, he would not be losing to him again. Hearing about the hot spring, Mimosa starts to wonder about it and ask, but neither Asta or Yuno answer her. Finral Roulacase shows with a new haircut and Magna Swing and Luck Voltia do not recognize him, and want to fight him for wearing the Black Bulls uniform without permission. Finral reveals its him and that he wanted to pump himself and start from fresh so he asked Vanessa Enoteca to give him a new haircut. Along with Asta, they start to mock him, he went a bit overboard. Noelle Silva sees her bother Solid Silva, who asks her if she is there to embarrass them again and its better if she leaves, however, Noelle refuses and wishes to show her brothers and sister that she had grown.\nJulius Novachrono welcomes all the knights that showed up for the Royal Knights Selection Exam. Augustus Kira Clover XIII steps out and announces it will be a team battle: a magic crystal destruction battle tournament. There will be two crystals on the battlefield on each team side and those who destroy the enemy team's crystal first, will be the winners. The time limit is 30 minutes and if the crystal is not destroyed by that time, those who done more damage to the enemy's crystal will be the winners. Augustus tries to explain why they chose this format, but as he does not know, Julius takes over and explains that fighting against the Eye of the Midnight Sun will require several squads to work together. They believe this is the best way to measure everyone's cooperation and strategies and its better than simply fighting each other with brute force. They announce the teams and Asta sees he is with Mimosa and Xerx Lugner. The man who took Xerx's robe appears, apologizing for being late and places his had over Julius's shoulder and hopes to be forgiven as he had to save an old lady. Marx Francois shoots at \"Xerx\", who dodges and joins the other Magic Knights. Marx is about to reveal \"Xerx\" is not the real one, but Julius stops him and jokes that Xerx had changed a lot. The Magic Knights get angry for disrespecting Julius, however \"Xerx\" explain that unlike them, he does not respect Julius and they should not push their values on him. \"Xerx\" approaches Asta, shaking his hand and stating they should get along as they are in the same team, however, Asta sees \"Xerx\" places a rainbow stinkbug in his hand and it stinks badly. \"Xerx\" laughs and states he has no intention to get along with an airhead like Asta and is only there to make fun of people. The knights wonder if \"Xerx\" was always like this, but as he is stationed on the borderlands, only few people actually know him.\nTeam C consists of Sol Marron, Magna, and Kirsch Vermillion, and Sol and Manga quickly end up arguing about their sizes. Team P consists of Yuno, Noelle, and En Ringard. Team K consists of Puli Angel, Luck and Klaus. Team E consists of Finral Roulacase, Leopold Vermillion and Hamon Caseus. Team O consists of Dmitri Brint, Solid, and Alecdora Sandler. Cob Portaport uses Spatial Magic and transports all the teams to the main stage. There Julius reveals who will fight who, but explains that wins and losses would not directly affect if you pass or fail, but with more wins, they will be able to show more of their abilities. Noelle sees her team is facing Solid's team. Finral realizes that if his team wins, in the second fight they will face his brother, Langris Vaude. Asta gets excited that if they reach the final, they can face Yuno's team. The first round is starting and its Asta's team. Other Black Bull members come to cheer for Asta and the rest.\n", "Asta gets excited for the fight, but \"Xerx\" tells him to take it seriously as they need to scout the area and think of a strategy. Asta is annoyed that \"Xerx\" is correct and Mimosa Vermillion agrees too. She reveals she specializes in Healing Magic and Support Plant Magic, while Asta is a close range fighter with Anti Magic. She asks \"Xerx\" what magic he uses, but before he answers, they receive a hit on their magic crystal. As they get hit few more times, they realize its from a distance and decide to move and secure the crystal. Elsewhere, Rick Cornell observes them with Crystal Scope and informs his teammates to re-adjust their aim. Forte Gris had created a Fire Magic Burst Javelin and Curtis Warren is supporting it with Rock Magic Strong Bow. As they continue the attacks, Asta wonders what they should do, but notices \"Xerx\" is sleeping and gets annoyed. \"Xerx\" wakes up and states he does not care if he win or loses, and is tired from being up all night, so he needs to sleep to recover. Rick confirms with his Crystal Scope that \"Xerx\" is indeed tired and sleeping, but that annoys his teammates who prepare for a combo attack.\nMimosa uses Plant Magic Magic Flower Guidepost and locates the enemies and realizes their incoming attack. She warns Asta, who manages to nullify it. Since \"Xerx\" is being useless, Mimosa proposes that she and Asta try to get close to the enemy and destroy their crystal while Asta protects their crystal and she holds the enemy. Getting closer and seeing the enemy, Mimosa uses Magic Cannon Flower, however Curtis blocks her attack with Rock Fortress. Everyone is impressed at how much Mimosa had grown and continue to support Asta and his team.\nKnowing that Asta uses Anti Magic and they will be at disadvantage at close combat, Curtis and Forte decide to split while both act like they take the crystal with them. Mimosa tells Asta to go after the left one, Curtis, but moments later realizes that the other two had surrounded them and all three of the enemies are preparing for a range attacks and Asta alone would not be able to block them from the three directions. Suddenly Asta steps on a magic trap and gets paralysed, and Mimosa guesses one of them can use Trap Magic. As Asta falls to the ground, the enemy team launches their attacks. Mimosa prepares for the worst, however, little before impact, three Trap Magic spells activate and absorb and reflect back the enemy team attacks. Curtis, Rick and Forte gets defeated by their own magic attacks. \"Xerx\" laugh and states everything went fine and heads towards Curtis, who is still conscious and congratulates him for still managing to protect the crystal. \"Xerx\" tells Curtis that Magic Knights should be prepared for unknown magic as you cannot only with by launching big attacks and anyone who loses to him does not deserve to be a Magic Knight. Mimosa sees \"Xerx\" is using Ash Magic and realizes the Trap Magic is his. \"Xerx\" decides to not break the crystal as he has other goal, but then reveals he is joking and smashes it, earning the victory of his team. Augustus Kira Clover XIII comments that \"Xerx\" is a top candidate for the Royal Knights.\n\"Xerx\" returns to Asta and Mimosa and congratulates them for the nice team play and acting as decoys. Asta is annoyed he acted like that to the enemy team as they were good and grabs him by the collar, but \"Xerx\" states they still lost and their teamwork was better. Asta wonders what kind of team play he talks, when he triggered his trap, but \"Xerx\" states he had to fall to act as decoy and to fool your enemies, you need to fool your friends first. Mimosa guesses that \"Xerx\" seals magic effects in objects or the terrain by drawing magic circles, then uses certain conditions to activate them. She states that a huge magic trap like that one, must have taken an enormous amount of mana and time and wonders when he set it up as he was sleeping the whole time. However, \"Xerx\" states its a secret and walks away. Sol Marron and Magna Swing come to the stage, telling Asta to move as its time for their time, but both end up arguing with each other again. Asta wonders about their third person and Kirsch Vermillion comes all sparkling and stating everyone lacks elegance, while he is beautiful. Mimosa reveals its her big brother, but wishes he to disappears.\n", "While taking various poses, Kirsch Vermillion complains that the world is filled with unsightly things, but he was born so beautiful. Magna Swing is quite annoyed at Kirsch and tells him to shut up, however, Kirsch states he understands why such an ugly creature like him is jealous at such beauty. Sol Marron also gets annoyed and tells Kirsch the only beautiful one is Charlotte Roselei and that he is gross. Kirsch grabs her hand and bows, creeping her out, and tells Sol that she must not use harsh words and she must learn from him to be better. Kirsch turns towards Mimosa Vermillion and wonders if she came to observe her beautiful brother, but she tells him that he is creepy narcissist and wishes he to lose the round. Asta introduces himself, however, Kirsch suddenly stops being sparkly and tells him to not talk like they are friends as he cannot stand the sight of him, neither his mannerism, behavior, unsightly existence, dirty clothes or ugly muscles. Kirsch states the bodies should be beautiful as they are and only the weak one train. Asta states he indeed was weak and that is why he trained and now his muscle are his weapons. Mimosa tells Kirsch to win the round, which excites him, but she reveals its so that she and Asta could slaughter him in the next round. Yuno wonders who is Kirsch and Noelle Silva states he is Mimosa's brother and creepy vice-captain of Coral Peacock. Klaus Lunettes states that despite his looks, he does the most work as Coral Peacock captain, Dorothy Unsworth is always asleep.\nTeam C versus Team D is about to start. Asta, Mimosa and \"Xerx\" are leaving the stage. Asta wonders what is \"Xerx\" goal that he mentioned before and that despite all that, he intends to win next round with team work. As the battle start, Magna decides to not waste time and heads to break the enemy team crystal, but is stopped by enemies Chase Jackal spell. Kirsch states Magna has unsightly and crude way of fighting. He tells Magna that he is blessed to be able to use close and long-range magic, but his mana is crying and he needs read the flow of enemy's mana and let his mana guide him and use close and long-range attacks at appropriate times. Magna decides to listen and easily defeats the Chase Jackals and the enemy.\nMeanwhile, Sol uses Earth Magic Rampaging Mother Earth and intends to smash the crystal fast, but falls under enemy's Mud Magic Flash Bog, making her golem unable to move. Kirsch appears and wonders why is he surrounded by sloppy and simple-minded people. He suggests that Sol creates multiple smaller ones and can even hide them underground for ambush attacks. As she does, Sol easily defeats the enemy. Kirsch state that he will be guarding the crystal, but the enemy is attacking it, thinking its unguarded. Kirsch uses Magic Cherry Blossom Blizzard and blocks the area with storm of petals and illusions of himself. The petals form a clear path towards the enemy crystal and Sol and Magna attack and smash it. As they win, Sol and Magna gets pulled into Kirsch mannerism and end up posing with him, but quickly regret it. Klaus is impressed by Kirsch magic and believes he could be the next captain of Coral Peacock. Kirsch then tells Asta that he is next.\nTeam E versus Team F starts. Hamon Caseus gets inspired by Kirsch and wants to fight beautifully, but Leopold Vermillion just wants to beat everyone with his fire magic. Finral Roulacase asks if they can leave the attack strategy to him as Spatial Magic gives them incredible mobility. Using Spatial Magic, Finral moves Leopold around, helping him dodge an attack and lead it to friendly fire and then beat the enemy from behind. Finral then sets up Hamon and Leopold to easily destroy the enemy's crystal. Hamon brings out some food to celebrate their victory and Leopold decides to make it into a challenge on who can eat more. Seeing Finral and other Black Bull members, the Magic Knights start to realize that the Black Bull is indeed different from last year.\nTeam G versus Team H starts. Sekke Bronzazza starts to panic as he does not believe he is on the other's level, but as his participation was suggested by Jack the Ripper, he stated he could do it. Fragil Tormenta wonders if Sekke is strong like the Black Bull juniors and he confidently confirms it. He creates Sekke's Shooting Star and wonders if he should go and rampage on it. Langris Vaude states its a good idea and makes Sekke give him a ride towards the enemy's crystal. Heading straight towards the enemy crystal, they fall into multiple enemy traps, however, Lagris easily shaves the space and destroys their crystal. Langris tells Finral that he will never be something more than means to transportation and in their upcoming match to be careful to not get into his Spatial Magic, as he cannot guarantee his safety and it will make some people sad. Finral agrees and states to ensure that would not happen, he intends to win.\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "During the tournament, Charmy Pappitson wanders off to scavenge for more food from a forest.

Nozel's teammates are amazed by the captain's skills and power. Nozel notes that the enemy's spatial mage should have exited the hideout at this time and that due to Cob Portaport's spatial jamming spell, the mage will not be able to return to the hideout easily. Nozel resolves that he will not let Licht escape.\nIn another part of the dungeon, Kirsch Vermillion's Cherry Blossom Magic overwhelms more terrorists. Kirsch exclaims that his former arrogant side has been cast aside along with his hair, and because of that, his magic has become more beautiful. Noelle Silva interrupts him for being creepy and attacks the enemies with Sea Dragon's Waterballs. Ben Benfunk emerges from the cherry blossoms and hits an enemy with his Red Shine Mace.

He pities Magna Swing for missing the opportunity to come to this exciting place and then decides to go crazy so that he can boast about this to Magna.\nOn another path, Yuno has defeated several terrorists, and Sylph appreciates him. One of the terrorists claims that no matter what the Royal Knights do, it will be futile since the Eye of the Midnight Sun members will be reborn in their true forms soon. Puzzled by the enemy's statements, Mimosa Vermillion inspects the surroundings and realizes that the pattern on the wall gets more numerous as they go deeper, which unsettles her. Yuno hears something from the depths of the dungeon.\nAsta and Zora Ideale shout about their abilities to combat the enemy, while Mereoleona crushes the enemies with a single blow. Shocked by this, Asta and a copy of him exclaim that they had nothing to do and tell her to take a break. The two Astas inquire if the other is Grey. Mereoleona and Zora start questioning the clones and receive the same responses, and they cannot detect which of them is original as both of them are not emitting any magical power. Getting infuriated by this, Mereoleona sets both of them on fire. Asta uses his Demon-Slayer Sword to extinguish the flames and questions whether she was trying to kill him. Meanwhile, the copy uses Aqua Curtain to extinguish the fire and uses Healing Ray of Light to heal himself, thereby revealing himself as Rhya.\nZora is astonished by the amount of magical power emitted by Rhya. A fierce conversation occurs between Rhya and Mereoleona as they prepare to battle. Rhya attacks them with Dark Cloaked Avidya Slash, Mereoleona punches the spell, setting it on fire straight away, and says that Yami Sukehiro's attack packs more of a punch. Before Rhya can reply, she appears right beside him, punches him with Calidus Brachium, and says that he can burn for her brother's sake. Meanwhile, in the Crimson Lion base, Leopold Vermillion is staring out of a window next to the bed where Fuegoleon Vermillion is lying comatose. Fuegoleon's fingers subtly twitch.\nZora is amazed by Mereoleona's speed, power, and sheer combat strength. Asta is shocked that she is able to fight close range. Knocked back into one of the chambers, Rhya stands back up and heals himself. While Asta gets ready to fight, Mereoleona throws him back and orders him to just stay and watch. Rhya feels that she is more trouble than other people in the dungeon but she should not have such a big head for stealing the magic from them. Rhya hopes that his blades of light will be too fast for her, but to his surprise, she easily fends it off with her superhuman movements. She quickly charges towards him, appearing right above him to punch again, but Rhya escapes using Invisible Scout and attacks her from behind with Aqua Javelin. Mereoleona kicks the air, changing directions, and punches the spell, which reminds Rhya of Vetto's reaction speed. She punches him again, making him fly off. Rhya uses his most powerful Water Magic spell, Tainted Culvert Wyrm, but she easily catches it and evaporates it with a punch. Next, he uses Salamander's Breath, which she again counters, charges towards him, and barrages him with her punches. He releases a series of spells of various attributes and is frustrated when she counters them all.\nWatching the battle, Zora claims that she really is a beast and recalls that the Royal Capital was a stuffy place for her and she wanted to eat the meats of wild beasts so she lives more than 300 days of the year in the wilderness like a beast herself. She steeped herself in the natural world mana and her Mana Skin reached a higher level while she lived out there, and he concludes that she is a monster herself as others think of it as a rumor. Even though Zora had never heard about Rhya or his Imitation Magic, he feels that Rhya really is troublesome as he can use any attribute and can cast it more powerfully than an average mage does. He also spots that Rhya cannot use different attributes at the same time. Asta watches the battle closely, hoping to steal any of Mereoleona's moves.\nIrritated, Rhya pulls a Demon-Slayer Sword from his grimoire, revealing that he only needs to touch someone's grimoire to copy it. Rhya thinks back to when he first received his grimoire and felt that it suited him as he was empty inside. Licht disagreed, saying that Rhya likes everyone and carefully looks at people. Rhya reflects that Licht was wrong as all he was is a liar, slacker, and disloyal. Angered that the humans tricked and killed Licht, Rhya's face twists as he resolves to kill all the humans. He charges towards Mereoleona with the sword, but she breaks it with a punch, revealing that he cannot copy Anti Magic. Rhya notes her fist would have shattered off if the sword had been Anti Magic but she did not hesitate. Rhya is terrified of the magic power and superhuman strength she exhibits. Mereoleona asks him if he is out of moves, and Rhya realizes that she has surpassed Mana Skin and is controlling mana across the area. She then unleashes Calidus Brachium Barrage, and the constant attacks are too rapid for him to escape or to recover. Zora feels pity for Rhya, and Asta is impressed since he had so much trouble with the rest of the Third Eye previously.\nElsewhere, Yuno creates three Tornado Fangs behind his opponents. Analyzing Yuno's fights, Mimosa realizes that he has been using Mana Zone, even during the Royal Knights Selection Exam. As the team flies up a staircase, they hear the heartbeat-like sound again. Sylph claims that she has felt this mana before. Up ahead, a figure floats inside a ball made of light.\n", "Back at the Black Bull hideout, Grey requests Henry Legolant to turn the hideout back to normal, to which Henry replies that he has no mana left. Gauche Adlai digs through the hideout's remains for his merchandise of Marie and shouts back at Henry for his slowpoke attitude. Ignoring Grey and Gordon Agrippa's warnings, Gauche asks Henry to come down and help search. Henry gets down and absorbs all of Gauche's mana, causing Gauche to collapse. After a while, Gauche finds the box containing the merchandise. He notices a smudge on the cheek of a doll and vows to kill the Eye of the Midnight Sun members. Henry points out that they already left, so Gauche turns his anger on Henry but does not have the mana to attack him. Grey wonders what the terrorists stole from the hideout. Gauche claims that they might be just bluffing and remembers that Yami Sukehiro asked the Black Bulls to defend the hideout from bandits.\nAt the Golden Dawn headquarters, Yami is impatiently waiting for William Vangeance's arrival and yells at the Golden Dawns for staring at him. Two of the members offer him some tea but he shouts back at them for making him wait. The Magic Knights apologize politely for the actions of their vice-captain, Langris Vaude, and ask Yami to have some faith in their captain, claiming that he would not knowingly insult Yami. Thinking back on their past meetings, Yami does not think of William as a liar and trusts William despite his instinct.\nMarx Francois enters the Magic Emperor's room. He is unable to find Julius Novachrono anywhere or to contact him through his Communication Magic. Marx worries about Julius for not being serious about his works as the Magic Emperor. Julius stands atop a castle wall and gazes at the Royal Capital, pondering about the Royal Knights expedition. Shortly after he hears footsteps approaching and welcomes William, saying that it is not often that William requests to meet him. William thanks Julius for making time and recollects the past, growing up as a cursed child in the Forsaken Realm and then becoming the heir for a noble family. Julius was the first to acknowledge his strength despite his looks, gave him the mask as he was conscious of his scar, and opened for him a new path as a Magic Knight. William always respected Julius for this and dedicated himself to Julius, who feels embarrassed on hearing this. William continues that he climbed up as the Golden Dawn's captain to create the ultimate squad as the best way to repay Julius and for some other person who is always within him even before Julius met William. William states that both of them are important to him and both walk a different path. William refuses to choose between them and asks for them to decide themselves. William's scar slowly disappears as he transforms into Licht, the leader of Eye of the Midnight Sun. Julius admits that he had hoped that this was not the case.\nJulius had always felt that William was always hiding something from him, which Yami felt too and deduced that maybe that was why Fuegoleon Vermillion was caught off guard as he encountered a familiar face. Julius also suspected William in several instances but never really thought that there were two souls in the same body. Julius asks Licht about the scar. Licht looks back at the past and resents that he trusted humans but he felt that William was an exception who was able to understand his feelings and helped him so far and also says that he will collect all the magic stones to complete his objective. Julius appreciates William for being such a kind person. Julius gets clear of Licht's motive to get revenge against humans and that Licht requires the two other magic stones which Julius possesses.\nLicht opens his grimoire to prepare for battle. Off in the Golden Dawn base, Yami senses something. Licht starts out by attacking Julius with swords of light, which Julius easily stops by using Chrono Stasis Grigora, educating him that Light Magic is indeed the fastest magic but that does not mean it is unstoppable. Licht tries to test Julius's agility by creating countless light swords, which Julius counters anyways. Licht feels ironic that he was born with Light Magic as only it has the power to oppose Time Magic. Licht then uses Bright Judgment Whip, which Julius dodges using his magic. Meanwhile, the rumbling from the battle alerts Marx and the other Magic Knights in the palace. Licht assumes that Julius is using a combination of Mana Zone and time acceleration to anticipate what happens in the near future. Licht thinks that Julius should not have underestimated him and appears behind Julius, striking with his sword.\nBoth of them settle down on a platform. Julius has a wound across his chest. Licht looks down on Julius for being slow and says that even if Julius can see what happens ahead, there are limits on how quickly Julius can evade. Julius describes the true nature of Time Magic: to steal and store time from his target. Julius reverses time on his wound, which astonishes Licht. Julius says that as one born with magic to steal futures, his goal as Magic Emperor is to create an indiscriminate future where everyone lives peacefully, and promises that until that happens he will not die. Licht charges at him saying that such a future cannot happen with humans.\nConfident in his speed, Licht tries to ambush Julius again from behind but to his surprise, Julius becomes faster and appears behind Licht. Licht thinks that Julius was able to anticipate things faster and tries to counter-attack him, but Julius destroys his light sword and states that he can already see the future where Licht cannot defeat him.\n", "The impulse from the ongoing battle attracts the people from the Royal Capital. King Augustus Kira Clover XIII seems to rest peacefully in spite of the ruckus. Marx Francois rushes out to see through the window and senses that it was Julius Novachrono who is fighting, as for the opponent he deduces that someone who uses Light Magic and keeps up with Julius's speed might be Licht. Marx calms himself and the panicked Magic Knights behind him and analyzes the situation. Marx realizes even if the Magic Knights try to assist Julius they will only be in the way and the only ones who can follow it are the Magic Knights Captains and he contacts them right away using Communication Magic. Marx informs them about the situation and asks the Magic Squad Captains to arrive at the castle after securing their district.\nThe situation at the Crimson Lion turns into chaos as Mereoleona Vermillion was supposed to be fighting at the enemy's base but their leader is spotted here. Leopold Vermillion steps up and takes control in spite of losing his chance to avenge his brother. At the Golden Dawn headquarters, Yami Sukehiro hears the message and immediately takes off, hoping that what he imagines should turn out wrong.\nAs the fight continues, Julius starts to mock Licht for his dull movements. Licht destroys some structures during the fight but Julius prevents them from falling down into the city by using his Restraining Magic. Licht gets surprised that Julius was able to keep up with his movements and wonders how far in the future can Julius really anticipate. Frustrated, Licht throws a light spell onto Julius which he catches using his magic and redirects at Licht with a higher speed. Licht evades it but Julius appears behind trying to catch him but Licht escapes in the nick of time. Julius acknowledges Licht's speed as even though he was able to anticipate Litch's moves he was not able to capture him. Licht gets to know that Julius is not fighting back as he was trying not to hurt William Vangeance's body. Astounded by Julius's strength, Licht wonders what kind of grimoire he has because it seems superior to his four-leaf grimoire and inspects where it is. Sensing this, Julius points at his grimoire which appears to have only a bunch of pages with no cover or binder. Julius starts to explain how unique the grimoire was and tells his tale as the Magic Emperor.\nLicht realizes that as he was trying to disturb the natural order of the world, Julius was created by fate in order to stop him. Julius appears behind Licht to capture him again but Licht becomes determined that he should defeat Julius at any cost. Licht flies off into the air and releases his Seal Magic while shouting out \"try to protect everyone\". Julius senses that Licht's magic has swelled up and shortly after Licht prepares a spell, where countless Light arrows envelop the Clover Kingdom. Julius did not anticipate that he had enough magic energy to overwhelm the entire kingdom and hopes that he does not plan to attack the people but to his surprise, Licht says that even though he will not be able to take Julius down he will kill everyone in the kingdom.\nOut in Hage village, Sister Lily and the others wonder what was shining above the kingdom. As others start to worry about this, Sister Lily calms them mentioning that even if it is omniscient, they still have Magic Knights on their side. While rushing towards the castle, Yami spots the countless light arrows above and becomes more concerned about Julius. As the people look at Licht's spell, some of them wonder if this is the end. Licht casts his spell, Arrows of Judgment, making the countless arrows fall down.\nJulius thinks back at his past where the nobles had high mana but served no purpose at all and get mentioned as one possessing a bizarre grimoire. Julius was searching for a purpose in his life while fighting as a Magic Knight and recalls the encounter with Zara Ideale, who was different from the others as he prioritized helping people above all, so Julius praised him as a true Magic Knight. A little while later, Julius learned of Zara's death and, while going to pay his respects, he encountered a young Zora Ideale, who ran off even before Julius could talk with him. Later, Julius came to hear about how Zara was killed and the nobles did not care about this. Julius feels frustrated because the nobles are becoming too arrogant and the poor gave up even though they had the same potential. Julius then thinks about how he had to become the Magic Emperor in order for his voice to he heard about changing things. Julius continues to contemplate how things have been slowly changed by those that he believed in. Recollecting all these memories, Julius decides that he cannot let it end now and immediately uses Chrono Anastasis, which stops and erases Licht's spell.\nLicht acknowledges Julius for the tremendous Time Magic he used to save the entire kingdom. Licht continues that even though Julius knew that he was about to attack him, Julius did not cancel his spell to evade him because Julius is the Magic Emperor, his only weakness. As Yami arrives at the scene, he is shocked to see Licht stabbing Julius with a light sword. Julius spits up blood and collapses on the floor. Licht takes the remaining two magic stones from him. Furious, Yami takes out his katana and confronts Licht, calling him \"Vangeance.\"\n", "Standing beside the fallen Julius Novachrono, Licht introduces himself to Yami Sukehiro as the captain mistook him as William Vangeance and informs Yami that William is sleeping inside him. As a teardrop falls from his eye, Licht corrects that perhaps William is watching the fallen Magic Emperor. Yami asks Licht to prepare for whatever happens next and also notices the startled Marx Francois, who was watching Julius being defeated. Yami orders Marx to hurry up and get Owen so they can heal Julius. Valtos appears using his Spatial Magic and calls out to Licht. Noticing this, Yami tries to cut off his escape route, but Licht quickly escapes with Valtos and tells Yami that they will never understand each other. Yami then checks up on Julius who compliments Yami about his spell and says that Yami is an amazing Magic Knight. Julius feels happy that the next generation of Magic Knights has grown up well, the generation after that is starting to bloom, and his wish will live on with the Magic Knights.\nBack at the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base, Mereoleona Vermillion continues her assault against Rhya trying to burn him to ashes. Rhya realizes that he stood no chance against Mereoleona and decides to self destruct himself so he can kill her. Sensing this, Asta quickly intervenes before Mereoleona could punch Rhya and throws Rhya off using his Demon-Slayer Sword. Rhya recognizes that Asta knows about the spell and is astonished on how fast Asta can be. Asta shouts that he already watched the other two self destruct and punches Rhya in the face asking him not to throw away his life. Asta questions what the Eye of the Midnight Sun is doing, and he has no idea about their revenge against humanity since they are human too. Asta also asks to hear their story since he will tell them his, and that they cannot die until that happens. Mereoleona grabs Asta for butting in on their fight and tells him that the Eye of the Midnight Sun has no intention of understanding them and that they need to crush the enemy now. Asta asks Mereoleona why, since the Eye of the Midnight Sun members are human too and that they are angry because something precious to them was hurt.\nAsta also says that he has been thinking about it for a while as they are fighting each other because they cannot forgive one another. Julius thinks about how he wanted to create a kingdom with no discrimination or hate. Asta also tells Mereoleona that he wants to create a land where everyone is free to laugh and smile together when he is the Magic Emperor, Mereoleona thinks about how Asta is proclaiming something overambitious without any hesitation. Rhya thinks about how Asta is serious and how there was someone like Asta a long time ago. Rhya also thinks that if everyone was like Asta then things might be different, but then comments that there is no stopping them now.\nValtos and Licht appear near the stone tablet and are greeted by Sally and Rades Spirito. Rades inquires why it took so long and asks if Licht was able to acquire the remaining magic stones. Valtos replies that things got better than what was planned and Licht has killed the Magic Emperor. Licht felt unstoppable and that it is finally the moment.\nYami asks Julius to hold on a little longer. Julius warns Yami that Licht has something else planned since Licht already had the power to kill everyone in the kingdom and apologizes to him as he let Licht take away the magic stones from him. Marx travels along with Owen in a flying carpet hoping that they will make it in time. Julius also feels that Marx would be angry at him for letting this happen and he wishes that he would be there when Fuegoleon Vermillion wakes up. Yami says that he will not let Julius just die like that, and thinks about how Julius convinced him to join the Magic Knights, working with Julius as a Magic Knight, and when Julius had made him a Magic Knight Captain. Hearing this, Julius tells Yami that he leaves the rest up to him. Yami cries out and slowly stands up and salutes him saying that he can leave things to him. Julius feels relieved from Yami's reply and happy about meeting numerous people and various kinds of magic. Meanwhile, Julius's blue star mark and his grimoire vanish slowly, and Julius dies. Yami proclaims that they will protect this kingdom.\nAt the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base, Cob Portaport wonders if everything is going as planned. Inside the base, Yuno's group reaches the central room. Mimosa Vermillion warns everyone to be careful since incredible mana is inside. Yuno replies that no matter the opponent, he has no intention of losing. Once inside the room, they notice that someone is floating in it. As the others wonder about the person, Sylph seems to know the mana.\nAt Licht's location, Licht takes out the two magic stones and starts setting it in the Tree of Life Monument. Before setting the final stone, Licht rejoices that after setting it their true power will awaken. The three of them devise on what they can do after attaining power. Valtos expresses that he is indebted to Licht as he changed his future, and the others agree to follow Licht, too. Licht tells the others that he is so proud of them for all their hard work and also reminds them about their long-cherished dream finally coming true, making others fall in excitement. However, Licht then expresses his true feelings on how twisted they all are and how truly disgusting their existence is. Licht places the final stone into the monument while saying that they will be the foundation for the rebirth.\nThe monument starts to glow and people from various locations of the kingdom notice this, and it also reaches all the way to the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base. Starting to glow, Rhya realizes that the rebirth has started, and Zora Ideale senses danger as Rhya's power dramatically increases. Rhya states that they are going to regain their true form and power while he slowly changes to an elf.\nThe person in the central room wakes up. Sensing the terrifying magic power the person has, Mimosa says that they need to withdraw but notices that Yuno is also glowing.\n", "Looking back at distant memories, a four-leaf clover grimoire containing Sword Magic chose Licht during a ceremony in a Grimoire Tower. A young elf asked his mother about the symbol, and she explained that it was a sign of good luck. The young elf, Patolli, became acquainted with Licht and Rhya. Patolli inquired Licht about the rumors of humans planning to attack the Elf Tribe. Patolli added that humans are a wicked race who hunt animals for sport and even though humans have weak magic as they grew in the population, it may pose a threat to elves. Licht replied that humans are afraid like the elves are and that these two different cultures should understand each other since they are bestowed grimoires from the same earth.\nLicht then noticed a magical tornado running wild and heard a woman scream from inside. Licht leaps toward the tornado while another person approached behind the tornado. Licht struck the tornado with Origin Flash and the other struck it with Lamp of Avior which destroyed the tornado. Patolli marveled at Licht's magic and compared it to the human's which equaled Licht's strength. Licht caught Tetia as she fell, and she thanked Licht for saving her. Her brother teased her for getting caught despite possessing Wind Magic, and Tetia apologized to him. Licht noticed that the brother also had a four-leaf clover grimoire and showed his own grimoire.\nSometime later, Rhya and Vetto noticed that Licht and the two humans had been getting along quite well. Rhya noted that Licht was happy that he has human friends who share his idea. However, Patolli was worried about Licht.\nTetia's brother suggested that the elves could make the world a better and safer place if they would combine their mana power with human magic technology. Later the elves celebrated Licht and Tetia's pregnancy, and Rhya teased Patolli, who refused to be treated as a kid forever. At a feast before the wedding ceremony, Rhya arrived late while Vetto and Fana teased Rhya about his lacking attitude. Rhya picked a fight with Patolli, noticing he still sits next to Licht and said that he will not be able to sit beside Licht after he gets married. Patolli argued with Rhya, but Tetia suggested that Licht belongs to everyone and not only to her even after the marriage, to which Rhya appreciated her kindness. Fana inquired about Licht's feeling about being a father in a few months. Licht replied that he feels happy and the child is his future which builds the bridge between humans and elves.\nAt the wedding ceremony, everyone congratulated and blessed Licht and Tetia, and Tetia's brother asked Licht to take care of her. Licht thanked everyone and told Patolli that he was looking forward to what grimoire Patolli would receive tomorrow. Patolli was happy as Licht remembered and thought that Licht looked very happy and that it had been a long time since he saw Licht in such a state. At the same time, Patolli was still quite uncertain whether elves and humans could understand each other. After the ceremony, a barrage of Light Magic rained down on the elves and a barrier prevented the elves from using magic to defend themselves. Watching the slaughter, Patolli remembered that Tetia's brother was a Light Magic user, and vowed never to forgive humans. Patolli was struck down before he could finish his statement. The last thing Patolli saw was Licht standing up with his wife in his arms and creating magic circles overhead.\nPatolli was surprised to wake up and to find he was not dead. However, when he looked into a mirror, he saw that he looked like Licht but the mana told him it was a human body. Patolli then realized that Licht must have cast a forbidden Reincarnation Magic spell before he died. Patolli looked out the window and sensed the souls of the other elves, figuring out that he was the only one truly reincarnated. Patolli noticed a grimoire on the bed but he could not use it as it belonged to the other soul present in this body. Patolli headed to a Grimoire Tower. Patolli did not know whether it was coincidence or not, but he was reincarnated into Licht's form as he was the chosen one and will portray himself as Licht from here on. In the tower, Patolli received a four-leaf clover grimoire containing Light Magic. Patolli promised that he would revive the elves and destroy the humans.\nAfter a while, Patolli used Evil Eye to revive Rhya in a body that resembled Rhya's own and also explained how difficult it was to revive him. Patolli asked Rhya not to get in the way of his mission, with which Rhya agreed while calling Patolli Licht. Rhya noticed Vetto and Fana behind Patolli. Patolli then described how he revived Vetto and Fana in a similar manner. Patolli then said to them that he was only able to reincarnate them and it will take enormous mana and sacrifices in order to revive the rest of the elves, so he decided to gather the magic stones by using the humans themselves.\nIn the present, as Patolli's goal has succeeded, he gives a twisted face while stating that they were the foundation of the resurrection. Rades Spirito then realizes that Patolli has fooled them and accuses Patolli of it. Rades, Sally, and Valtos then start to feel the effects of the tablet. Patolli explains to the three of them that he marked them to be sacrificed for the forbidden magic. Rades tells Patolli that he has never used the name that Patolli gave him and only went on his own. Remembering when Patolli told him that they are precious comrades, Valtos asks if they are comrades, to which Patolli replies that they are precious sacrifices to revive his comrades. Rades, Valtos, and Sally then all die as their souls leave their bodies.\n", "At the Eye of the Midnight Sun base, Rill Boismortier apprehends the terrorists using his Painting Magic and asks them about their leader's whereabouts. The terrorists start to die which leaves Rill in confusion since he did not do anything. All the terrorists in the base except Rhya die which leaves the Royal Knights flustered. People at various realms of the Clover Kingdom feel disturbed by the glowing light where the stone tablet was. At the Black Bull hideout, Grey comments about how it differs from the swords of light, which Gauche Adlai says that it is another attack from the Eye of the Midnight Sun. The light slowly vanishes and darkness fills in but subsequently, Grey and Gordon Agrippa is shocked as Gauche starts glowing.\nVarious people across the kingdom start to glow, including members of the Royal Knights. Asta wonders why Rhya is glowing and says that he will explain what is happening once he stops glowing, but Rhya grins and responds that the humans' era has come to an end. Mimosa Vermillion wonders what is going on with everyone as Klaus Lunettes, Hamon Caseus, and Yuno have suddenly changed appearances. Klaus tells Mimosa to be quiet since she is not one of them. As the revived elves all attack the humans across the kingdom, Patolli feels that the time for revenge has come.\nYami Sukehiro wonders about the light and starts to sense strong magic presences throughout the kingdom. Yami becomes sharpened as he recognizes familiar ki and as he hears some quarrel down, Marx Francois and Owen ascend using Qualle Operation. Yami says that it's high time they showed up and questions them of their appearance and actions. They reveal that they are elves who have taken over Marx's and Owen's bodies and that they have come to destroy all the humans of the Clover Kingdom for revenge. Yami recalls about the reincarnation and says that it is going to be a pain as it was not Eye of the Midnight Sun being possessed. Hearing Yami, the elf possessing Marx decides to end his suffering and starts attacking him with Torment Canceler and the other elf also starts attacking him. Yami precautiously covers Julius Novachrono's corpse with Black Cocoon and maintains his distance while noticing that their powers had skyrocketed. The elves notice that Julius's body is important to Yami and decide that they will destroy it in front of him. Angered by what his friends are being forced to say, Yami leaps at them. Marx fires more arrows, which Yami absorbs with Black Hole and cuts Qualle Operation into pieces by Dark Cloaked Avidya Wild Slash and knocks them unconscious with Dark Cloaked Avidya Blunt Strike. Yami then comments about how powerful they had become even though they were non-combat mages.\nYami jumps off as giant red roses start to bloom from where he was standing and as it cradles Owen and Marx, an elf possessing Charlotte Roselei appears, reprimanding the other elves for letting their guard down. The elf remarks Yami to be quite powerful. Yami calls her as the Spiny Prickly Queen and states that it is not like how she is usually for which she replies that she does not know of whom he speaks but will fight him as long as he is human. While chaos spread across the Royal Capital, Yami continues to fight the elf, Yami thinks that even if the Capital gets destroyed, the kingdom will continue as long as the citizens are safe and sense that it will be troublesome if she continues the rampage. Despite the elf hiding her presence among the scent of roses, Yami was able to find her using her ki and slashes with Dark Cloaked Avidya Slash. Impressed by this, the elf mistook that it was Yami's instinct and continues to attack him. Yami clears off her misunderstanding and realizes that the way she moves resembles Charlotte but her combat tactics are different and realizes that knocking her unconscious would be impossible.\nYami thinks back on how Charlotte's roses had turned blue when she was cursed and that they stayed blue even when the curse was broken, Yami concludes that the true form of Briar Magic has been awakened by the elf. As Yami continues to battle the elf he comments about how pathetic it is since someone else is controlling Charlotte's magic even though Charlotte had become strong while using her weakened magic. Sol Marron shows up bruised with her Rampaging Mother Earth and asks Charlotte if she has mistakenly attacked her own squad members. The elf tells Sol to stop talking to her so familiarly, and that she has a younger brother and no sisters. Yami leaps onto the golem and asks Sol to take away the cocoon saying that he will handle Charlotte. Sol argues with Yami and refuses to run away. Sol gets down saying that she will bring her sister back to her senses and tries to use her Earth Magic but she realizes that she cannot control her magic within the space of the elf's magic and gets astonished on how Yami was handling her. Disappointed, Sol recalls her past and feels indebted to Charlotte. Sol gets determined to turn her normal even if it kills her but Yami stops Sol and knocks some sense into her for which she pleads with Yami to bring back her sister despite her pride and leaves.\nThe Elf tries to trap Yami with briars but Yami absorbs them using Black Hole. Yami closes the distance and tells Charlotte that she always had his respect and she is not that weak to let an elf do whatever she wants with her body. The elf backs off acknowledging Yami for his strength and decides to go all out to kill him. Seeing this, Yami senses trouble and thinks that if he also does not go all out there will be casualties. Their spells, Scarlet-Braided Beautiful Battle Spear and Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash, clash against each other.\nBack at the dungeon, Luck Voltia and Ben Benfunk glow which surprises Noelle Silva as she recognizes it is powerful and is similar to Vetto's magic. Luck grins.\n", "Sol Marron buries the Black Cocoon with Julius Novachrono's body. She hears the explosion from Yami Sukehiro's and Charla's spells clashing. Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash slices through Scarlet-Braided Beautiful Battle Spear and cuts off Charlotte Roselei's arm guard, but the two halves of the Briar Magic spell still hit Yami and cause the nearby buildings to collapse on him. Charla leaves to meet up with Licht and takes the unconscious Marx Francois and Owen with her. Sol sees Charla leaving and makes her way over to the street to check on Yami, who emerges from the rubble and still wants to fight. He orders Sol to go help the citizens while he has other plans.\nIn the dungeon beneath the Magic Knights Headquarters, Catherine's and George's corpses are lying on the floor. Gueldre Poizot and Revchi Salik have been freed by the destruction caused by the rampaging elves. The two former Purple Orcas get into an argument but bond over their shared hatred for Asta. A possessed Silver Eagle drops down into the dungeon and prepares to attack them. Gueldre turns himself and Revchi invisible, and Revchi then binds the elf in chains.\nIn the floating dungeon of Gravito Rock Zone, Luck Voltia and Ben Benfunk have been possessed and the pair hug. The elf in Luck attacks Noelle Silva with a Thunder Arrow but misses. Kirsch Vermillion raises a storm of cherry blossom petals and orders Noelle to raise a defense, but the elf clads himself in lightning and crashes through her Sea Dragon's Nest.\nElsewhere in the dungeon, Rhya believes Asta was truthful about his dream but the elf still decides to kill the boy. He lashes out with combined Light Sword of Judgment and Dark Cloaked Avidya Slash. Mereoleona Vermillion destroys the attacks and tries to catch him in Calidus Brachium Barrage again, but Rhya combines Light Magic and Spatial Magic to dodge her punches. He then sends light beams through Myriad Black and manages to land hits on Mereoleona, Asta, and Zora Ideale.\nLira, in Rill Boismortier's body, comes crashing through the ceiling and riding atop a Four-Headed Lindworm that he painted. Lira is excited to see Rhya and hugs his friend. Asta calls out to Rill, but Lira does not recognize the boy and sends his painting to attack the humans. Zora activates the landmine traps he had spread around the room. This blinds the elves temporarily and gives Asta time to enter his black form. Asta cuts off the heads of the lindworm and manages to land a hit on Rill. However, the Anti Magic is unable to break the Reincarnation Magic spell on the captain.\nThree more possessed Royal Knights drop down from the ceiling, so Zora figures that they should retreat, with which Asta agrees. Mereoleona punches a hole in the wall, throws Zora and Asta out of the room, and then covers the hole with rubble as she plans to take on and kill all five elves herself.\nIn the Crimson Lion base, Fuegoleon Vermillion is lying in bed and his hand twitches.\n", "At the Crimson Lion Headquarters, Fuegoleon Vermillion still lies comatose and their Magic Knights are engaged in a fight against an elf, who is possessing the vice-captain, Randall Luftair. The elf comments on how weak humans are and the Magic Knights plead their vice-captain to stop the rampage as they sense intense magic power from him. The elf states that he will not stop until all the humans die. As the Magic Knights lose hope, Leopold Vermillion reminds them of their pride and asks them not to wither. Hearing this the elf uses his Air Magic to show them the disadvantage they are in. Leopold thinks about how his air magic was supplementing his Fire Magic but the situation had reversed now.  Leopold concentrates and fires his Spiral Flame but the elf puts it out using Air Blockade and damages him with Crushing Air Blast. Leopold stands back and disagrees that he will lose which boosts the morale of his teammates. The squad members decide to go for an all-out attack which ends out in vain as the elf moves out swiftly and takes out them.\nLeopold launches a surprise attack on the elf which he anticipated and counters him with Crushing Air Blast but Leopold senses the attack as he reads the mana and dodges it. The elf claims it to be luck and charges at him but as Leopold counters it, he depicts that Leopold is adapting quicker and he needs to finish him off. Three fallen squad members steps in commenting about Leopold's growth rate and that they are willing to sacrifice themselves to buy time so that Leo and others can escape. Leo disagrees and tries to fight with them but he falls down and realizes that he had reached his limits. As the mages are distracted the elf closes in and defeats them, he also comments that Leopold will not become the captain since he will kill him right here. Leopold tries to force his body to move and refuses to believe that he is going to die here. Suddenly the elf and Leopold sense strange mana as the castle engulfs in enormous Fire mana making Leopold think that another enemy had appeared as it is powerful as the elves. But as Leopold senses it to be warm and embracing Fuegoleon with an arm made of flame steps out commenting that Leopold had done a good job. Fuegoleon extends his arm while the Salamander comes out, he declares that as the captain of Crimson Lions and as Leopold's brother he will never lose again.\nFuegoleon recalls how the Salamander sought him while he was in comatose. Fuegoleon appreciates everyone's effort as he felt the fiery mana coming from their battle. Leopold is amazed and acknowledges his brother's strength. The elf comments about how a human is receiving the blessing of a spirit but still looks down as he is just a human. Fuegoleon says that he will not hold back and launches Salamander's Breath, as the elf tries to erase it he notices that the flames are too intense for his magic to destroy and also feels suffocated. Using this chance Fuegoleon restrains the elf using Leo Palma. The squad cheers for Fuegoleon and Leopold thinks about how incredible his brother is, and how he will surpass his brother one day. Leopold then tells Fuegoleon that while he was asleep, their sister had taken over his duties which surprises Fuegoleon. Fuegoleon thinks about how his sister was originally supposed to be captain and how he had made her do something out of character. Fuegoleon senses that things have escalated quickly when he was sleeping and recalls the incident when William Vangeance as Licht caught him off guard and sliced his arm.\nAt the Golden Dawn headquarters, several elves have gathered possessing the squad members and discusses among themselves. An elf possessing Langris Vaude, Ratri, enters the hideout stating that he was imprisoned in a peculiar place. An elf tells Ratri, that the one that reincarnated them was his cousin Patolli. Ratri says that they will show the humans that the white night has ended and that the golden dawn will rise and is itching to kill humans.\nElsewhere Finral Roulacase snaps out of sleep and wonders what is happening. Yami Sukehiro kicks him out of bed and tells him about the situation. Finral feels the same ominous mana that he felt from his brother and decides that he will save his brother this time.\n", "Rhya sardonically asks Mereoleona if she is trying to stall the elves for her teammates to escape but pities her considering the disadvantage she is in. Mereoleona says that they will only be in her way and she is enough to take care of them. Rhya laughs at her reply and tells that after they kill her they will capture Asta as his swords and grimoire belong to the original Licht. Mereoleona challenges that they need to defeat her first for that and charges at Rhya with Calidos Brachium Barrage but he escapes using Spatial Magic and regroups with the other elves. Outside, Zora and Asta argue about aiding Mereoleona. The elf possessing Puli uses Angel Wing on Rhya and comments on how humans are arrogant. The battle between the five elves and Mereoleona starts. As Mereoleona continues to battle she realizes that her senses are dropping and notices that it was due to Fragil Tormenta's Snow Magic: Miniature Garden of Illusory Snow which forcefully makes everyone sleep in the chamber except the elves.\nThe elf which has taken over Ruben, Rossa, charges at Mereoleona with his Sand Magic, and as she tries to counter it, he changes to Variable Hardness Prison and captures her. As the elves think they had won, Mereoleona breaks through the trap and charges at Rossa to kill him but Rhya intercepts with Spatial Magic and slashes her with Dark Cloaked Black Blade saying that he will not let another of his comrades die, Puli Angel then barrages her with Angel Flapping. When Rhya thinks it is over, suddenly a blue flame strikes him which he manages to dodge. Mereoleona appears wounded out of the smoke telling the elves to try killing her, seeing this Rhya doubts whether she really is human and feels troublesome. Mereoleona tries to attack the elves again but hits the floor. Rhya decides to finish the fight, Mereoleona agrees with him and decides to finish the elves with her ultimate spell thereby releasing all her mana which makes the elves dumbfounded. Mereoleona uses Calidos Brachium Purgatory which burns the entire chamber with blue flames but the elves manage to survive with some damage at the end. The elves acknowledge her power and Rhya compliments Mereoleona about still standing while being unconscious. Suddenly, Mereoelona wakes up and tells them to come at her and finish this even though she had no mana. Impressed by her persistence the elves decide to finish her with a combined spell.\nSuddenly, Asta and Zora break into the chamber. Rhya comments about how that was foolish and launches the Compound Magic: Elemental Quintet. In a flashback, Asta and Zora discuss a strategy about rescuing Mereoleona. Zora speculates about how the odds are in their favor and it happened only because Mereoleona pushed the elves to that extent. Zora steps in front of the spell and captures it with his Trap magic. Zora then reflects the spell at Asta, who reflects it back at Zora using Demon-Slayer Sword. Zora catches the spell again but notices his magic circle is breaking apart. Asta suddenly appears behind the spell and reflects it at the elves thereby returning it quadrupled to the elves. The spell hits the wall behind the elves, Asta grabs Mereoleona and leaves with Zora by making a hole at the base using his Ash Magic. As they are trying to escape, Rhya appears out of a black portal and grabs Asta's arm dragging him before they could resist. While being dragged away, Asta leaves Mereoleona to Zora, much to his dismay. The other Royal Knights who are not possessed leave the dungeon.\nIn Licht's chamber, the possessed Klaus Lunettes and Hamon Caseus capture Mimosa Vermillion as she tries to flee from them, securing her in a steel cross.

Outside the Eye of the Midnight Sun's dungeon, Zora Ideale rests the unconscious Mereoleona Vermillion beside a tree and worries about Asta.\nIn the central chamber of the dungeon, Asta yells out to Yuno, the elf possessing Klaus comments it as futile. The elves in Hamon and Klaus decide to quiet down Asta and attack him with their Creation Magic, Asta counters their attack and requests them to stop as they are comrades. Klaus's body reacts from Asta's words, angered by this the elf insists that his resentment for humanity is greater than his host's relationship with Asta and attacks him. Asta manages to cut the steel drills but it manages to pierce him and he kneels. The elves decide to finish him off to take his grimoire and swords. Asta stands back and declares that he will survive this and become the Magic Emperor. Hearing this, Yuno recalls his childhood memories. As the elves attack Asta, Yuno interferes with his Tornado Fang and declares that he will be the one to become the Magic Emperor, showing that he has come back to his senses.\nAsta and Yuno discuss the situation among them, Rhya gets shocked as Yuno did not turn into an elf and worries about Licht as he did not wake up yet even though his grimoire is in front of him, concluding that they may require some time to fully awaken. Klaus gets disappointed about this and decides to kill them, Yuno easily overwhelms the elves attacks. Klaus and Hamon decide to go all out to attack Yuno. Yuno suggests Asta run away with Mimosa saying that he will take care of it. Asta laughs out loudly at Yuno's statement and stands beside him ready for the battle. The elves say that with the grimoire of this generation they can ascend the spells and use Le Ch\u00e2teau de Verre. Yuno uses Spirit Dive and Asta transforms into Black Asta and they defeat the elves together, making them pass out.

Yuno senses the incredible mana from Licht and as Asta is astonished about Licht, Nero comes out and pecks him.\nLicht picks the Demon-Destroyer Sword from the ground and Asta feels troublesome as he senses Licht's Ki and realizes that his black form is nearing its limit. Yuno warns Asta, but before Asta could even reply Licht stands in front of him and takes the Demon-Dweller Sword from Asta, restores, and swings it which makes them fall back. Licht continues to attack Yuno with a series of swings which Yuno barely deflects and as he closes the distance with Yuno, Asta intervenes and fights him in close combat. Licht defends himself and throws Asta away. Spotting the opening, Yuno uses Liable Tempest to bind Licht, and Asta charges at him to slash him using his Demon-Slayer Sword but Licht appears behind Asta smashing him to the ground. Licht kicks Asta, and attacks him with a series of swings which Asta barely defends. Yuno tries to use his Gale White Bow but Licht quickly appears in front of him and throws him off. Yuno asks what Asta plans to do for which he replies that he is going to surpass his limits right here, but suddenly a blow from Licht's swing smashes him through the walls and Licht kicks him down into a pool of water, as Asta loses his black form.\nYuno chases Licht and uses Spirit Storm on him but Licht manages to absorb it all using the Demon-Dweller Sword and swings it back at him. Licht starts to battle with Yuno in the sky while Asta thinks about how strong Licht is and that he needs to fight back. Rhya comments about Asta and Licht's power while Mimosa worries about being helpless. Yuno starts to keep up with Licht's speed and dodges his swings. Yuno sees an opening and attacks Licht using Spirit Storm from behind. Sensing this, Rhya yells at Licht. Licht manages to absorb the attack with his Demon-Dweller Sword. As Rhya gets to relax on worrying about Licht, Asta breaks through the floor in his black form and charges at Licht breaking through the dungeon. Rhya thinks that the timing is perfect and wonders who they both are. Asta and Yuno attack Licht together when he was busy absorbing the spirit storm while yelling that they are rivals of each other and that they will not lose to him. Licht manages to block them using the Demon-Destroyer Sword but the sword flies off due to the thrust and Asta catches it mid-air. Licht then unleashes a magical blast from the Demon-Dweller Sword.

The other Royal Knights defend themselves from the blast waves.\n", "Licht comes back to the dungeon and Rhya asks him if it was fine to blast Asta off since Asta was possessing his grimoire and swords. Licht responds that it is not his grimoire anymore. Rhya feels hopeful as it does not matter as long as Licht is present.

Zora replies to Asta's question and comments on how lucky Asta is to get back alive. Asta asks Zora about Mereoleona Vermillion's condition. Zora replies Mereolena is still lying unconscious below the tree and it is better not to wake her yet. En Ringard and Nozel Silva address the crowd, En tells them that his other teammates have turned into elves and they managed to escape from them.

Suddenly, contact is cut off and Nozel says they have to save the kingdom even if it means killing their comrades. Noelle comments about how Luck is fighting back because of how they were not hit and that they were even able to escape.

Zora says that they should be reaching the forsaken realm soon, where they notice that the elves have begun their attack. Both Asta and Yuno notice that the place being attacked is Hage, and say that they have to go to save the villagers.

Asta replies that Hage is also a part of the kingdom, Nozel responds that if they want to go that badly then they should finish what they want to do quickly and then head to the capital. Both Asta and Yuno salute and agree to Nozel's terms. Noelle says that she will head out too, but Nozel orders her to stay and tells her that she is royalty and will protect the capital with him.

The children gather around the poisoned father, Nash wonders what kind of monster the elf is. Lily says that she does not know what had happened to the elf and asks what the villagers have done to the elf. Lily then comments about how even though the villagers cry, work, and suffer, they can also laugh and still dream. Lily starts to cry and comment about how the villagers have to meet such a sad end even though they do all they can in order to live an earnest life. The elf replies that the source to all the villager's suffering is because of the humans. As the elf started to attack, Nash remembers what Asta and Yuno told him before they left. Nash steps in front of Lily and tells the elf to not lay a hand on her while preparing to attack. When the elf's attack is coming closer, Asta and Yuno suddenly appear and deflect the incoming attack. Asta and Yuno tell Nash that he did well and that they will handle the rest. Nash starts to cry seeing them.\n\n", "In Hage, Asta and Yuno defend against the possessed Purple Orca's Poison Plant Magic.

Suddenly, the new sword emerges from his grimoire, and Asta grabs it and receives a rush of memories and Anti Magic.\n", "Asta remains shocked from the surge of power coming through the Demon-Destroyer Sword. Asta closes his eyes to concentrate and he gains control over the sword which then absorbs all the poison from Hage villagers negating the cause and effect relationship of the poison. Orsi Orfai wakes up well which leaves the children in surprise. Asta feels excited about the new power he gained from the sword and hopes that it would cure his friends who have turned into elves.

The elf disagreed with Rhya, stating that the flowers were not poisonous and he felt that they were pretty. Licht joined them and said he was happy to receive a gift from the elf. The elf were convinced after hearing Licht's explanation of humans, but the elf then recalls the massacre and remembers the feelings of deception.\nAsta experiences the same feeling from the elf, as he had when Vetto and Fana were about to self-destruct. Yuno and Sylph also notice this as the mana swells up making the elf's soul gets out of control. Yuno and Asta teams up to free the elf from his suffering. As Yuno blocks the elves Poison Plant Magic with his Tornado Fang, it creates a path for Asta to strike the elf directly with his Demon-Destroyer Sword negating the Reincarnation Magic.

Hearing what the elf said, Asta and Yuno feels happy and bids farewell to their home, they leave with Digit by using Heavenly Wind Ark. Somewhere in the forest Magna Swing and Vanessa Enoteca were practicing and observes a dungeon moving towards the capital.

Magna and Vanessa gets surprised as they see Luck was responsible for the attack and questions him. Lufulu attacks them but Magna questions him again. Lufulu tells them he possess Luck by Reincarnation Magic and it was too late for them to meet Luck. Magna gets confused from Lufulu's reply, Vanessa clarifies it to be a forbidden magic probably caused by Eye of the Midnight Sun. Magna states that the boulder they saw earlier might be the hideout of Eye of the Midnight Sun and concludes that the mission of Royal Knights has failed. Lufulu appreciates Magna's intelligence and informs them the Royal Knights have been completely wiped out, he also warns them that they will die if they are going to stand in his way.\nLufulu tries to kill Magna but he ends up crashing elsewhere, he notices that Rogue was the one who made him miss. Magna tries to attack Lufulu but Rogue touches Magna making him to fall down. Magna complains Vanessa about her magic but she reasons that if he were to attack Lufulu he would have died and it was Luck's body which the elf possesses. Magna replies that is why he need to wake up Luck and attacks with Explosive Vanishing Scattershot. Lufulu senses the fireballs mana though they had vanished and escapes from it. Lufulu claims that no magic spell can reach at his speed and counterattacks Magna. Vanessa uses her Thread Magic so Magna can dodge and offers to be as backup. Magna attacks Lufulu with Timed Explosion Scattershot but still he manages to dodge them. Magna mixes some regular scattershot so he could distract Lufulu and get behind him, but Lufulu shortly senses his mana and closes distance between them. \nMagna grins saying that he knows how fast Luck is and explodes the fireball in his hand, causing both of them to take damage. Magna informs that Luck would have known that he is foolish enough to explode himself as he never fall for this and boasts about his resilience. Magna attacks Lufulu with Maximum Exploding Fireball causing Lufulu to crash the ground and uses Flame Rope Solid Binding Formation to restrain Lufulu. Magna tells the elf that he cannot win against him since he know nothing either about him or Luck and demands to return Luck. Hearing this Lufulu laughs and suddenly Lightning strikes him, which Asta also notices as he was travelling towards using Heavenly Wind Ark. Lufulu frees himself and enhances his armor questioning Magna who cant beat whom stating him as mere human. While Magna prepares to attack Lufulu, Lufulu disappears using his speed and bounces between buildings saying that their attacks will never reach him again.

After a while, Magna ends up being choked by Lufulu and Vanessa fallen to ground, while Lufulu comments on how it ended quickly. Lufulu tells them that it is the fate the elves bestow upon the humans of Clover Kingdom. Vanessa and Magna declines Lufulu's statement and ask him to give back his friend Luck. Lufulu teases them for having a bond but shortly Lufulu starts to cry which becomes evident that Luck is still inside him.\nMagna challenges Luck to come out saying that he got a lot stronger than he was while Vanessa slowly binds Lufulu with her threads. Lufulu gets angry and frees himself, he prepares to kill Magna by using Thunder Arrow but Vanessa uses her final Red Thread of Fate to reel down Asta from the sky destroying the Thunder Arrow using his Demon-Destroyer Sword. Lufulu retreats and questions Asta, Asta replies that he already knows who he is and tells him they are Luck's friends, transforming himself to Black Asta. Lufulu gets irritated from Asta's reply and mocks him for lacking mana. Asta tells him that despite having no mana Black Bull were the first one to acknowledge him and that is why he wont let them take anyone. Lufulu bounces around saying that Asta cannot track his movements and tries to attack Asta from behind but to his surprise Asta counters it and chases him. Doubted from Asta's agility Lufulu questions him, Asta replies that his Ki is filled with rage and his sword being sensitive towards powerful magic making him follow wherever he goes. Lufulu feels annoyed and attacks Asta with multiple Thunderclap Crumbling Orb, Asta counters them easily and throws him away. Lufulu starts attacking Asta, which makes Asta feel surprised as Lufulu cant sense where he his and is attacking with just his battle intuition.\nAsta calls Magna and Vanessa to help him out, Magna attack Lufulu with fireballs and Vanessa throws huger rocks at him. Using this distraction Asta tries to attack him but Lufulu easily dodges his attack saying that he had figured out Asta's speed and kicks Asta away.  Asta feels that he has reached his limits and needs to end it quickly while Lufulu also prepares to kill him, Magna prepares a smokescreen using his fireballs to hide Asta. Lufulu spreads his mana to detect Asta's location and notices that he is heading straight to him so he closes the distance and tries to attack Asta but Vanessa stops Asta just a moment before Lufulu strikes using her thread tied down to his leg. Magna throws his fireball immediately to release the thread and Asta slams down Lufulu using his Demon-Destroyer Sword while thinking how their feeling are more tenacious. Asta thinks that he will free Lufulu, but Lufulu envelops himself with lightning. As Asta thinks about how Lufulu still has so much power, Lufulu tells Asta that the humans are the ones that are goes to die. As Lufulu goes to kill Asta, Magna and Vanessa hold down Lufulu.

She asks him to come with her but he hears the Black Bulls calling for him so he decides to return to his friends. Luck remembers his interactions with his squadmates, while Lufulu remembers the first Magic Emperor. As the Reincarnation Magic is broken, Lufulu smiles and wishes he could have been friends with humans. Luck stands up and cries, asking if they are all still friends. Magna hugs him and says that they are.\nThe Black Bulls return to their base, with Luck pulling them along with his improved Lightning Magic. They find Gordon Agrippa, Grey, and Henry Legolant sitting among the wreckage of the base. After they relate what happened with Gauche Adlai, Charmy Pappitson approaches the base in a threatening manner. She is not possessed but is furious that someone destroyed her garden. The others blame the Eye of the Midnight Sun and the elves, so Charmy creates a sheep that cooks magic-restoring food. Henry sits separately so he does not drain the others' magic, but Asta invites him over since they can eat more food to make up for any drained magic. Once Henry is able to reassemble the base, he shapes it into a running bull. The Black Bulls head inside and race off to defend the kingdom.\n", "As the Black Bulls members are reunited, they charge towards the Royal Capital with their base in The Raging Black Bull's charging form.

Asta then uses the Demon-Destroyer Sword to break the Reincarnation Magic.\nElsewhere near the stone tablet, William Vangeance recalls his past about having another soul and how he shared dreams with it before Julius Novachrono helped him. At the age of 16, Patolli awoke within him, and seeing two grimoires, William confirmed that there were two souls present in his body. They learned to swap and communicate with each other. William learned about Patolli's past and his mission to resurrect elves and take revenge on humans. William felt guilty as he was hurting everyone over the years with his inability to decide which path he should choose. Since Patolli defeated Julius, William remorsed for Julius and bids farewell to Patolli, allowing the elf to take complete control. Patolli wakes up from his slumber and realizes that his reincarnation is complete now with William under endless sleep. Patolli thanks William, his only human friend who understood him, and leaves William's grimoire before the stone tablet.

Rades decides to take his revenge on \"Licht\" and resurrects Sally and Valtos.\nBack at Hecairo, Asta announces that he has cured all the three possessed Magic Knights but is interrupted by the arrvial of Rades, Sally, and Valtos. Rades offers his help to Asta in order to exact revenge upon his betrayal. Asta declines his offer as they are trying to protect the kingdom and not to impose revenge on anybody. Asta also restrains Rades for the ruckus he caused earlier at the Royal Capital. Asta orders Rades to save the people and help them reach the Royal Capital and also asks Valtos and Sally if they are willing to help them. Valtos remains confused by Licht's actions and simply wants to hear the truth from him, so Valtos decides to help. Sally, on the other hand, is indecisive and thinks only of research. Asta offers to let her experiment on him if she will help them, to which Sally quickly agrees.

Owen stands in as Julius Novachrono to keep hidden the fact that Julius has been turned into a child.\nWhen King Augustus Kira Clover XIII takes the stage, the people are not very thrilled to see him. Jealous of Julius's popularity, Augustus attempts to make a speech and to win over the favor of the people with a showing of his Light Magic. However, he and his spell are interrupted by the sudden arrival of Yami Sukehiro and Jack the Ripper, who are fighting each other. Yami and Jack are confused what it going on, so William Vangeance has to explain it to them. Charlotte Roselei calls them out for being late and for fighting over something ridiculous, and Fuegoleon Vermillion and Nozel Silva tell them to stop and to remember where they are. While this goes on, the people start to think that the Black Bull squad should not have come second in the Star Awards Festival and that they truly are the worst squad because of Yami's behavior and Asta's possession of a devil.\nAugustus is furious with the captains' interruption, but William suggests that he show them leniency and mercy. The King leaves, dragging Sekke Bronzazza behind him. The captains also leave the stage, and Owen is relieved that it is finally over.\nFollowing the ceremony, all nine squad captains, along with Asta, Noelle Silva, Mimosa Vermillion, Finral Roulacase, and Secre Swallowtail, are brought to a meeting room. While everyone is waiting for Julius to arrive, William apologizes to Yami, saying that it should be his squad that should be receiving the praise of the public, and not him. Yami replies saying that they are used to being booed by the public. Charlotte tries to stay calm while sitting next to Yami but her face flushes. Yami and Jack tease her about it, which causes her to lash out at them, and the three begin bickering.\nFinally, Julius, with Marx Francois and Damnatio Kira in tow, arrives to the meeting. Julius explains that Damnatio is there since the matters that they will be discussing will also concern him. With this, Marx reveals that what they will be discussing is the devil that resides in the Spade Kingdom. He then goes on to tell the captains that a few members of the Magic Knights went to the Heart Kingdom to find out more about the devils. He says that even though they have all seen the reports, he would still like to hear from the ones who were actually there.\nAfter Mimosa, Finral, and Noelle explain the Magic Stages, Julius says that they will not stand a chance against the devil unless everyone fighting is First Stage or higher. Julius also reveals that Megicula's powerful curse on Princess Lolopechka has about another year before it kills her. \nMarx adds on that the Diamond Kingdom is under attack by the Spade Kingdom and that over the past few years, the Spade Kingdom has become more and more powerful, with them suspecting it is very likely that they have gotten help from Megicula. Julius follows this with how Lolopechka plans to attack the Spade Kingdom in six months before she grows weaker and how he is think of assisting the Heart Kingdom and fighting alongside them. Julius then adds how he wants all the squad captains to train their squads to raise their Magic Stages over the next six months. He also reveals that the Spirit Guardians will help them out.\nWilliam, Charlotte, and Kaiser Granvorka ask to be relieved of their duties as captains for what they did when they were possessed by the elves, but Julius rejects their offers since they will need the strength of everyone who was possessed. Julius then asks Damanito's opinion on everything. Damanito has no objections and, as he leaves, adds that he is only agreeing to it because it benefits the Clover Kingdom and that doing otherwise at the moment would not benefit them. After Damanito leaves, Asta goes up to Julius and thanks him. Julius says once again that he is counting on everyone.\nFuegoleon says that he needs to make plans for his squad's training, while Nozel suggests that all the squads train together. Charlotte says that doing mock battles is a good idea, while Jack says he will not hold back. Yami responds that that is his line. Kaiser suggests that rounding up some healing mages for the training would be a good idea, with Julius adding to not get carried away.\nJulius then has Gueldre Poizot brought into the room. After revealing that Gueldre and Revchi Salik managed to steal a large amount of ancient magic items and jewels from the Shadow Palace, Julius planning on pardoning Gueldre because of the former captain's knack for business, which will benefit the reconstruction effort of the kingdom. Gueldre agrees to help out. Julius then announces that he will halve the salary of the captains. All the captains agree, other than Yami and Jack, who become upset with this.\nLater that night, all the captains go to a bar. Yami and Jack, who are both drunk and still upset about their pay cuts, start making fun of Fuegoleon. As the other captains begin to leave, Yami and Jack grab William and force him play a little game. Jack and Yami plant to earn their lost salaries from William's losses. William agrees to play but ends up winning everything off of Yami and Jack, who fall asleep at the table. After placing blankets on them, William says that he is very grateful to them for still treating him the same despite of everything that has happened. He promises that he will do everything in his power to defeat the devil. William salutes them, says good night, and leaves. He then pays and apologizes to the bar keeper for causing such a fuss.\n", "Asta, Noelle Silva, and Secre Swallowtail, in her bird form, are traveling by broomstick across the country to Hage. Asta complains about Noelle's terrible flying and voices that he should have just run to Hage as he originally intended. Noelle scolds him for wanting to go on foot as that would have taken days and claims that Asta should be grateful that she offered him a ride. Before leaving, Noelle claimed that she had gained better control of her mana and was now able to fly a broom properly. Secre decides to fly on ahead and Asta realizes that he should have just had Finral Roulacase make him a portal.\nAs the demon skull comes into sight, Noelle finally gets her broom steady. Yuno and Sylph, who are also traveling to the village, fly past them. Seeing this, Asta lets go of the broom and runs after them. After catching up and calling out to them, Asta asks if they are also heading to Hage, to which Yuno responds that they are. Asta challenges them to a race to see who can reach the church first and runs off as fast as he can. Sylph calls him childish, and Yuno agrees with her but accepts the challenge. While Asta and Yuno are racing, Secre flies to a field and picks a flower with her beak.\nThe people of Hage were hard at work cleaning up the mess caused by the elves attack as Asta sped through the town. Just as Asta was about to reach the church, Yuno flew past him and landed on the churches roof, winning the race. After a trade of bickering, Asta and Yuno are greeted by Father Orsi Orfai. Orsi brings up Asta's trial, and Asta and Yuno immediately clarify that the trial was a farce. Orsi explains that he already knew that, as did everyone in Hage. They are all grateful to Asta and Yuno for saving them. Orsi then shows them his framed copy of the news article and asks Asta to sign it, much to Asta's chagrin.\nYuno asks where everyone is, causing father Orsi to fall to his knees and start crying. He tells the boys that the other children have all left. Walking through town, Orsi explains that the people of Hage, after being inspired by Asta and Yuno's success as Magic Knights, banded together and worked hard to build a schoolhouse for the children. Orsi and Sister Lily Aquaria work there as teachers.\nWhile Asta and Yuno are making their way to the school, Secre flies up to the top of the demon skull, reverts to her human form, and places the flower she picked earlier in front of the stone fragments that chipped off of Lemiel when he was awakened. While Secre is reminiscing about her prince, she hears something coming from the demon's mouth. She discovers Nash complete a set of 300 pushups and chug down a bottle of Mogura Leaf juice. Nash notes how disgusting the juice is, but continued to chug more, just as Asta did. Nash shouts that his mana is replenished and begins to practice his Fire Magic. He remembers Asta's ideology: it does not matter if you are a poor orphan, you can still aim to be great.\nAsta and Yuno arrive at the school house, a repurposed food storehouse. Asta reminisces about how he and Yuno used to play hide and seek in that very building when they were younger. Asta notes how Yuno used to cry when Asta could not find him before it got dark, but Yuno denies that that ever happened. Upon arrival, Asta and Yuno are mobbed by an admiring crowd of children. When the children see Sylph, they mistake her for a doll and grab her out of the air to play with her.\nLily emerges from the school. Asta wastes no time in walking up to her, getting down on one knee, offering her flowers, and asking if she would marry him. Lily responds as she usually does, hitting Asta with her Holy Fist of Love. Asta's loud marriage proposal echoes across the entire village and the villages are not surprised to hear it, knowing it was just a matter of time. Noelle, who has finally made it to the village, hears the proposal as well and becomes flustered, mistaking the proposal as being for her and causing her to lose control of her broom. She crashes her broom into Asta and yells at him for it. She begins to address his marriage proposal but is cut off by meeting Orsi and Lily. They recognize Noelle from Asta's letters, and Noelle is surprised to learn that Asta has written home about her. Noelle fantasizes that Asta might have written about being in love with her, so she sprays Asta with a water blast. Secre then arrives at the schoolhouse and hides behind a tree. Asta introduces her as Nero, the Black Bulls' newest member.\nSister Lily asks Asta and Yuno if they would be teachers for the day, believing that the younger children would benefit greatly from learning from the heroes who inspired their village. Asta and Yuno agree. In the classroom, Asta strips off his shirt, jacket, and squad robe and tells the children that magic equals muscle. He says that even though the children do not have much mana yet, they could make up for it with physical strength. While all the boys follow Asta to run laps, the girls stay in the classroom playing house with Yuno, Noelle, and Secre.\nAfter completing their lessons with the younger children, Asta and Yuno are taken to the \"New Leaves\" class, where the older generation of students are preparing for their own upcoming Grimoire Acceptance Ceremony. Teaching the class are the two boys who confronted Yuno after the Grimoire Acceptance Ceremony for showing them up by receiving the four-leaf clover. Surprisingly, they greet Asta and Yuno happily, apologize for back then, and state that they turned over a new leaf. The school's headmaster and the keeper of the Grimoire Tower, Drouot, comes in and gives the class a quick lesson about grimoires.\nWhile walking back to the church, Asta and Yuno state that the cannot stay very long, so Orsi decides to have a big feast while they are here. He invites Noelle and Secre as well, though Noelle is not looking forward to the dry food. As they walk, Asta sees Nash and calls out to him. At first, Nash is exited to see Asta but, being his usual prideful self, pretends that he does not care about seeing Asta. Asta asks why Nash was not at school and questions if he cut class. Nash replies that he was busy, and Asta scolds him for ditching. Orsi and Lily explain to Yuno that there is nothing wrong with Nash's attendance record. They pretend that they do not know what Nash is doing, and Secre knows exactly what they are talking about, having seen Nash earlier that day trying to be like Asta.\nBack at the church, Orsi is dealing with a crowd of villagers who want to donate food to Asta and Yuno, while Lily, Secre, Sylph, and the children are in the kitchen preparing dinner. Noelle sets the table while still wondering about what Asta might have written about her in his letters.\nAsta and Yuno are overlooking the small village that they came from and think about how far they have come and how their adventure is not even close to being over. They think about how much stronger they still have to become and the impending war with the Spade Kingdom.\n", "The Black Bulls are gathered in their hideout and considering how they will spend the next six months preparing for the upcoming battle with the devil-possessed mage whom they saw conquer the Diamond Kingdom. Before they can make any plans, they hear a loud banging at the front door. Before Magna Swing could even reach the door, Mereoleona Vermillion barges in and questions where Yami Sukehiro is. The Black Bulls say that he is away at the moment. Mereoleona is slightly disappointed, but is ultimately uncaring. She uses her Fire Magic to grab hold of them all and takes them with her for a training session at the Ultime-Volcano Mountain Trail. There they meet Fuegoleon, Leopold Vermillion, and the rest of the Crimson Lion squad.\nMagna notes the extreme heat and Asta realizes that it can be very harsh for someone their first time at the Grand Magic Zone. Since they were brought to the volcano against their will, Fuegoleon uses a magic tool to help them use Mana Skin. Asta, on the other hand, having gained better control of his Anti Magic since the last time he was there, coats his body in Anti Magic to protect himself from the mana-made heat.\nAsta starts racing for the top but is immediately stopped by Mereoleona. She explains that they are not climbing to the top, but instead descending through the much more dangerous underground cave in a race to the center. The volcano's heat comes from underground mana, so the deeper they go, the more intense the heat. In addition, the cave is full of monsters that are perfectly adapted to the extreme conditions. However, at the center of the caves, there is a hot spring even better than the one at the summit.\nWhile everyone is charging in, Charmy Pappitson tries to convince Gordon Agrippa to escape with her, believing that they have no place in the nightmarish training ground. Mereoleona, having overheard them, allows them to leave, reiterating the dangers of the cave and stating that the weak have no place there. Gordon and Charmy accept the unspoken challenge, Gordon because he wants to become stronger for his friends sake, and Charmy because she wants to make a meal out of the cave monsters.\nAsta and Leopold are racing each other through the cave, pushing themselves to the point of exhaustion. On the other hand, Secre Swallowtail is riding on Asta's head in her bird form, only accompanying them for the hot spring. Noelle Silva is pushing herself as her Mana Skin begins to weaken, the heat causing her to hallucinate, specifically Asta in a swimsuit and a beach in the background. When Noelle returns to her senses, she sees Asta right next to her, and as usual, sprays him with a blast of water.\nLuck Voltia and Magna are climbing up the side of a cliff above a pool of magma. Magna questions if this route is actually a shortcut, to which Luck responds that he is actually heading in the direction of a strong potential opponent he was sensing. Magna complains that they should instead be looking for the goal. As they climb, Magna is hit in the face several times by rocks, which he accuses Luck of doing on purpose.\nGordon waits for Charmy who is casting a fishing net into a lake of boiling water but having no luck catching anything. Gordon proposes that there might simply be nothing in the lake to catch. Charmy immediately dismisses that idea, believing that her meal instincts are never wrong. Luck and Magna run into Gordon and Charmy.\nA giant spider attacks the Magic Knights and Noelle gets caught in webs. Leopold attempts to fight the spider back with his Fire Magic. The spider is pushed back but seemingly unharmed. Mereoleona and Fuegoleon fly in on Salamander and reveal that drawing out the spider was the real goal. It has a natural instinct to hide from fights it cannot win, so it would not reveal itself to Mereoleona whenever she tried searching for it. Salamander destroys a wall, uncovering an underground dungeon.\n", "Once the rest of the Crimson Lions arrive at the entrance of the recently uncovered dungeon beneath the Ultime-Volcano Mountain Trail, Mereoleona Vermillion contacts Marx Francois for further instruction while everyone else takes a rest. Marx tells them that there is a special magic tool inside the dungeon that could help to rebuild the Clover Kingdom. Julius Novachrono offers to explore the dungeon as well, but Marx adamantly refuses as no one can see and find out about Julius's changed appearance. Julius says that he can go in disguise, but Marx still refuses.\nMereoleona sends a team of six in to scout out the dungeon, consisting of Asta, Noelle Silva, Luck Voltia, Magna Swing, Leopold Vermillion, and Randall Luftair. They find a chamber that divides into three paths. Before they can go down any of the paths, they must first deal with various Trap Magic spells placed around the chamber. Randall uses an advanced application of his Air Magic, enough to reveal the traps, but not enough to set them off. Luck charges forward not caring about the traps and setting them all off, and Magna gets caught up in them as he runs after Luck. Magna and Luck enter the middle passageway, while Asta and Noelle go down the passageway on the right and Leopold and Randall take the one on the left.\nAsta and Noelle run into an endless barrage of traps. Asta tells Noelle to get on his back so he can just bulldoze through the traps without having to worry about her. Noelle refuses, claiming that such a thing is below her status as a royal. Suddenly, Asta grabs Noelle and starts carrying her. Flustered at first, Noelle realizes that Asta is running back the way they came and sees a massive wave of lava headed right for them. They later reunite with Luck and Magna, who found a number of strange treasure chests with small human legs.\nLeopold and Randall reach the center of the dungeon and find the treasure room. They also find the fallen bodies of the stone golems that were supposed to be guarding the treasure. The two Crimson Lions are attacked by the monstrous spider who uses its webs to activate the other stone golems. Hearing the sounds of battle, the Black Bulls come to Leopold and Randall's aid. \nDuring the battle, Randall tells Leopold that he needs to survive, mirroring the events of the elf invasion, when the members of the Crimson Lions told Leopold that he needed to survive and that he would one day be the Crimson Lions' captain. Leopold questions what all of his training was for and feels insecure about Asta being so far ahead of him and about how the members of the Crimson Lion squad were always taking a stand to sacrifice themselves so that he could live on. He reaches a breakthrough, gaining the ability to compress his flames into a small but powerful blast. He also pulls in mana from the environment to boost his attack, singing parts of his clothes in the process. Leopold uses his newfound abilities to defeat the spider and the remaining golems.\nSecre Swallowtail flies over and discovers that the mysterious magic tool they had been sent to find was the very thing that transformed the once normal spider into a giant monster. Unfortunately, the magic tool was destroyed by Leopold's attack.\nAfter the scout team returns to the rest of the group, they receive Healing Magic and give their report to Mereoleona. Luck shows off one of the strange treasure chest creatures that he and Magna found. Despite protest from his squadmates, Luck opens the chest and finds it is filled with organs. Charmy Pappitson wonders if any of the organs are edible, but Gordon Agrippa believes that they are not.\nMereoleona, furious over the destruction of the magic tool, sends Leopold and Asta back into the dungeon and orders them to search every inch of it. The rest of the Magic Knights bathe in the hot springs. While the Black Bulls are relaxing, Fuegoleon Vermillion lectures his men on how to use the hot springs properly, preventing any of the Crimson Lions from actually enjoying the bath. In the women's bath, Noelle asks Mereoleona to tell her more stories about her mother after Mereoleona notes that Noelle's new spell is identical to that of her mother's.\nThe next morning, after searching the dungeon all night, Asta and Leopold return empty-handed. The Black Bulls fly back to their base, some noting that they had a good training trip. Magna has not forgotten that they were kidnapped and forced to go to that volcano and states that if he never sees Mereoleona again, it will be too soon. Luck notes the possibility that she is inside the base at that very moment. Magna scoffs at the idea, but as they reach the front door of their base, the door is blown apart, revealing Mereoleona standing there waiting for them.\n", "Mereoleona Vermillion grabs Noelle Silva, Asta and, by extension, Secre Swallowtail in her bird form and takes them to the Vermillion Estate in Clover Castle. In the banquet hall, Fuegoleon, Kirsch, and Mimosa Vermillion are already sitting at a large table. Fuegoleon states that what happens in the room is a matter of utmost importance that could potentially change the course of the Clover Kingdom's destiny and that everyone present is to keep the proceedings a secret. At first, the younger Magic Knights believe that they will be going on a secret mission that would impact the upcoming war with the Spade Kingdom. However, Fuegoleon burns away a nearby curtain, revealing Sister Theresa. As it turns out, the gathering is a party celebrating Theresa's fifteenth year as a nun.\nWhen asked about why the Vermillion siblings made such a big deal about a party, Fuegoleon explains that Theresa cares for many children and that children are the future. Mereoleona explains that the party had to be kept secret because Theresa does not like the spotlight. Asta questions why Leopold Vermillion is not present, and Fuegoleon explains that Leopold asked to use the time for training.\nA number of servants bring in a fabulous feast, but Theresa is not really interested, saying that she does not like big fancy meals. She was planning on not coming to the party at all, but the Vermillions also offered to host the children from her orphanage. The children are amazed by what they see. Among the children is one boy whose ki Asta feels he recognizes. Before Asta can think more about it though, the other children ask him to join them at the buffet. Theresa immediately recognizes the mysterious boy to be Gauche Adlai transformed into a child with the help of Grey's Transformation Magic. Gauche explains that he went to the church to visit his little sister, Marie Adlai, and snuck into the party when he found out she would be there. Theresa scolds the boy, reminding him that he is only supposed to visit his little sister once a month, and complains about him having no regard for the rules. Gauche states that it does not count since they ran into each other at a party they both happened to attend.\nFuegoleon gets everyone's attention and asks that all the Magic Knights perform some party tricks. Noelle and Mimosa are not sure what to make of this request, while Asta has no idea what a party trick is and hopes that someone will explain it. Theresa accuses Fuegoleon of being bad with words and asks that they simply entertain the children. Mereleona notes that in such a situation, Acier Silva would always be the first to jump in, prompting Noelle to go first. She uses her Water Magic to preform a ribbon dance. While Mimosa is doing her trick, Gauche claims that he could entertain Marie better than anyone. Theresa proclaims him the biggest clown of all for the trick he pulled just to be near Marie. Asta, now understanding what a party trick is, spins plates on the tips of his swords, earning the most applause from the children yet. Kirsch calls Asta's performance garish.\nFuegoleon thanks everyone for their performances. Theresa asks Fuegoleon what kind of trick he will do, much to Fuegoleon's horror. He pulls out three eggs and holds them between his fingers in his right arm. He carefully increases the heat of his arm's fire so that when the eggs are cut open, they are revealed to have all been cooked differently: one hard boiled, one soft-boiled, and the last jelly-soft-boiled. Fuegoleon explains that he was able to achieve this with proper mana control and states that the jelly-soft boil was the most difficult to achieve. He tries to explain further, but the children say they do not care, shocking him. Mereleona ridicules her brother for being boring and states that a real party trick needs passion. She uses her fire paws to grab the children and swing them around. Mereleona is proud of herself for giving the children a fun experience, but the children immediately start crying, confusing Mereoleona.\nAsta asks Theresa about what Mereoleona and Fuegoleon were like as children, expressing his belief that they were amazing, natural born warriors, even back when they were young. Theresa denies this and tells Asta about the embarrassing moments from back then: The time Fuegoleon asked for the most intense training possible so that he could get as strong as can be, but Theresa refused due to too much training at a young age having a negative effect, so he trained after bedtime and she disciplined him for it; how Mereoleona was as much a wild child back then as she is now; how Fuegoleon used to accidentally start fires everywhere and cried because of it; and the time Mereoleona went berserk because she set her own clothing on fire. Theresa explains that mana control is troublesome for young children at first, but with time and practice, they get better. Noelle realizes that she was a late bloomer so she could never control her magic. Asta compares this rule to wetting the bed, causing Noelle to slap him in the face.\nMereoleona and Fuegoleon get into an argument. Mereoleona claims that Fuegoleon was always getting into trouble and she had to bail him out, while Fuegoleon claims that she had it backwards, she was always getting into trouble and he had to bail her out. The argument quickly escalates into a trade of Fire Magic-powered blows. Theresa has Noelle create a shield of Water Magic to protect the children and tells the children to watch carefully and to not turn out like Mereoleona and Fuegoleon.\nKirsch and Mimosa begin arguing as well. Kirsch claims that he was always doing good for his little sister, and Mimosa saying that he was just being a burden over the years. For the second time, an argument quickly escalates into a battle of magic.\nThe fight between the two captains escalates further. Fuegoleon summons Salamander and Mereoleona powers up to full strength. Gauche steps out of Noelle's shield and reveals himself; he tries to attack the two captains as a means to protect Marie, but all of his attacks are blocked. As Fuegoleon and Mereoleona were about to clash, Theresa steps in between them, stopping both of their attacks with her bare hands. She was also able to stop the fight between Kirsch and Mimosa while she was at it.\nShe tells the Vermillions to sit, which they do. Theresa scolds them, acknowledging that all siblings fight, but there is a limit. She then tells Fuegoleon and Mereoleona that they are worse because they are in their 30s and are therefore too old for such nonsense. To get her point across, she creates a large hammer out of fire and bashes them both into the floor, and Gauche as well. Marie tells Gauche that he would not have been hurt if he had not snuck in. Theresa expresses her thankfulness that Marie is nothing like her brother. Theresa leaves with the children and mentions that her 100th anniversary of being a nun is in 85 years, if they can fit her into their schedule. As they are leaving the estate, Theresa notes that you do not get to be her age without learning a thing or two.\n", "Asta is tired and hungry after a long day of training. When he lifts his head, he sees Finral Roulacase sitting across from him. Finral tells Asta that he is cursed, shocking Asta. Noelle Silva appears out of nowhere and corrects Finral, saying that being a womanizing flirt is not actually a curse.\nFinral wants to train resisting his womanizing habits, so he invites Asta and Luck Voltia on another group date. Finral's plan is to dive right in by spending time with multiple pretty girls and not flirt with any of them. Asta invited Rebecca Scarlet to be his date. Also at the table was Karen Lapis, who just wanted to get married to any man, not caring about their character, and Eliza Zakkeroni, who only came because turning down the invitation seemed rude and just wants to go home so she can read.\nNoelle Silva and Secre Swallowtail follow their squadmates and take jobs as waitresses at the tavern. Noelle, scared that she might lose Asta to another woman, grips a pillar hard enough to crack it, which the tavern owner scolds her for. Secre uses her Sealing Magic to fix the cracks. Noelle asks Secre why she even came, to which Secre responds \"just because\". She then notices how cute Secre looks in the waitress uniform and Noelle tells Secre that she will handle Asta's table herself while she handles all the other tables.\nBack at Asta's table, while Asta chats with Rebecca about the recent accusations of treason against him, Luck expresses his wish to fight Karen, which Karen thinks is code for something. Meanwhile, Finral does his best to act nonchalant and disinterested in Eliza.\nFinral begins to feel that his anti-womanizer training is working, but feels bad for making the girls waste their evening. Eliza suddenly declares Finral to be the perfect man for her, greatly shocking him.\nAlso at the tavern, Sekke Bronzazza and his two friends, Aphro and Phati, are on group date with Rebecca's friends, Erika Sitate and Helene Barbary, and a third woman. Sekke tells lies about his involvement in resolving the elves' attack and the Magic Knights' possession. The girls are uninterested though.\nNoelle passes by their table and feels like Sekke seems familiar, but she cannot quite place him. She figures it out after hearing his signature laugh. Sekke calls Noelle over and asks her for a round of drinks. Noelle responds by blasting water in his face. \nAs Secre is taking a big order, the tavern owner notes that she is doing a great job and more than makes up for Noelle being a terrible waitress. As she is putting down drinks, Secre notices Langris Vaude and Finesse Calmreich sitting in disguises at one table and are watching Finral.\nIn a private room upstairs, Yami Sukehiro, Magna Swing, and Gordon Agrippa are on a group date with Charlotte Roselei, Sol Marron, and Puli Angel. The Blue Roses are trying to help Charlotte attract Yami. Though, the Black Bulls are only present because the Blue Roses agreed to pick up the bill.\nSol is rapidly gorging herself and complaining about how she might lose Charlotte to a man. Magna tells her that she will give herself indigestion. After a trade of insults, Sol challenges Magna to an eating contest, which he agrees to.\nCharlotte questions her outfit, but reminds herself to have faith in Puli, who as it turns out, often gave romantic advice to her fellow Knights.\nDuring an emergency meeting in the bathroom, Puli advises Charlotte to serve a plate for Yami, to listen attentively, and most importantly, to touch him nonchalantly. Yami coincidentally does these things for Charlotte. When Charlotte and Yami accidentally touch hands, Charlotte freaks out, runs away screaming, and jumps out of the window.\nShe then runs back into the tavern and trips over the hem of her dress. Finral catches her and almost gives in to his bad habits. Instead, he declares that his heart belongs to someone else. Charlotte is embarrassed at Yami seeing her like that and throws Finral down.\nKaren ditches Luck and realizes that she should have higher standards than just wanting to marry any guy. Eliza is disenchanted and notes that her only perfect guy is the fictional one in her favorite book.\nAfterward, the Black Bulls and Blue Roses all sit down at a table. Rebecca whispers to Noelle that she should be more upfront with Asta, as the boy is not too bright. After Yami demonstrates his obliviousness to Charlotte's feelings, Puli uses her Magic to reposition Charlotte's chair next to Yami's. Yami and Charlotte then share a toast to their next six months of training.\n", "Deep beneath the ocean, the priests of the Seabed Temple attempt to calm a guardian of the sea who was going berserk. Gio, having dubbed their efforts to be not enough, ordered Kiato and Kahono to retreat so that they could try again later.\nUp on land, the Black Bulls are training on the beach. Since the area has a strong presence of natural mana, it is an excellent place for mages to get stronger; water mages especially, being that it is by the ocean. While Noelle Silva is working on her control, she hears a strange song. She cannot identify it, but for some reason, it makes her feel nostalgic. Before she can think about it, she is interrupted by Asta, Magna Swing, Luck Voltia, and Finral Roulacase, who are participating in physical training. Finral falls behind and asks why they are not just practicing magic. Magna replied that Asta, as well as Captain Yami Sukehiro, had proved during the recent battle with the Elf Tribe that muscles are just as important as magic. Before they could continue their workout, Asta, Magna, and Finral fell into a pitfall, created by Zora Ideale, who had been practicing his Trap Magic.\nAfter the team took a break for lunch, Noelle heard the song again. She ran to investigate and was followed by Asta. Suddenly, Kahono and Kiato, emerge from the ocean and ask for their help.\nWhen the Black Bulls arrive at the Seabed Temple, High Priest Gifso explains that the temple guardians were injured trying calm a monster, a guardian of the sea who serves the Sea God, who had become restless due to an unexplained instability of the undersea mana. Gifso begs the Magic Knights to lend them their great strength. Noelle proposed that she could create a smaller, but more durable version of her Sea Dragon's Cradle, which would allow four people, herself, Kahono, Kiato, and one other mage to safely reach the aggressive guardian. Asta, Luck, Gauche Adlai, and Charmy Pappitson all desire to be the fourth, each with their own reasons. Yami ultimately decides that Finral will be the fourth team member, as he could use his Spatial Magic to get them out of danger.\nThe team descends down an undersea cavern known as the Void of No Return. On the way down, they are confronted by a strange group of fishman warriors, originally ordinary sea life that had been transformed into monsters by the unstable mana in the sea. Kahono and Kiato attempt to fight them off, but they manage to break through Noelle's protective bubble. She remembers what Lolopechka said about the Spirit Guardians being able to use natural mana. Noelle puts this into practice and creates a Sea Dragon's Cradle around herself and more of them around each of her teammates. After making it past the fish monsters, they were confronted by another guardian of the sea, the Kraken. The giant squid releases a shroud of ink, obscuring their vision and disrupting the surrounding mana. Noelle manages to strike the creature down using her Valkyrie Dress. They continue onward until finally reaching the bottom of the cavern.\nThe group find themselves in an ancient ruin of undisclosed origin, before they can discuss the ruin in detail, the guardian, a white whale with a blue lion's mane, ram-like horns, and jellyfish-like tentacles coming from the base of its head, emerges from the shadows. Kahono and Kiato begin the ritual to calm the beast. It appears to be working, but while the guardian was enjoying the performance, the mages discover the reason why the guardian had been so aggressive lately. The guardian was being protective of its baby. As the guardian and its baby were soothed by the ritual, the volatile mana in the ocean returned to its normal state, and the transformed sea creatures along with it. Noelle realizes that the song she was hearing earlier was the lullaby that the guardian was singing to its baby. Before leaving, the guardian touched its nose to Noelle's forehead, showing her an image of her mother.\nAfter returning to the beach, Kahono questioned if the Magic Knights were really satisfied with the small amount of sea food that they had been given as a reward. Kahono proposes that the she, Kiato, Noelle, and Asta go on another double date some time, like they did during the Star Awards Festival. Asta immediately accepted, which Noelle scolded him for, telling him not to answer for her. Finral begins to swoon over Kahono from behind a rock, but immediately reminds himself about Finesse Calmreich. Yami joins him and notes how far the spatial mage has come, noting that his progress really began during their first visited Seabed Temple.\n", "While the rest of the Black Bulls have been training to improve their combat abilities, Charmy Pappitson has been working to improve her cooking and its ability to enhance her friends' mana. She creates a magnificent feast for her squadmates, and it does indeed massively boost Magna Swing's, Luck Voltia's, and Noelle Silva's magic power. However, they lose control of themselves and start wrecking the base, despite Asta trying to stop them. Charmy is not satisfied with the results and wants her food to do more, so she goes to the Royal Capital and visits Jamo. She begs him to train her, and he agrees after seeing her determination. Jamo asks Charmy what her end goal is, and she explains that her magic allows her to make food that can restore and enhance the eater's mana, and that she wants to make food that can put her friends' magic in overdrive.\nJamo has Charmy undergo intense physical training, believing that she will not be able to improve her culinary skills by training her magic alone. Afterward, he sends sends on a quest to find three very rare ingredients: to the desert highlands for the bulb of a Mentanpin Mandoradora, to the middle of the sea for the Noonesheardofthis Coelacanth, and to the snowy mountains for the hide of a Surprise Yeti's rump. To Jamo's shock, Charmy returns to the capital with all three ingredients in tow. Although she collapses into Jamo's arms out of exhaustion, she still intends to use the special ingredients to make the ultimate meal for her squadmates that night.\nIn the Black Bull base, Charmy presents her dishes, which all look absolutely disgusting. As such, the Black Bulls all try to come up with excuses for why they cannot eat it. Asta acknowledges Charmy's effort and is willing to eat the dishes, despite how unappetizing they appear. Jamo begs the Black Bulls to eat, knowing what Charmy went through to make the dishes. Before anyone can eat, however, the three dishes come to life and join together to become a giant food monster. Finral Roulacase manages to get everyone outside the building before the meal monster can hurt anyone. Jamo refers to the monster as \"Demon Food\", a phenomenon that occurs when a massive amount of mana combines with the love of a devoted friend.\nYami Sukehiro arrives and tells his subordinates to destroy the monster, but the monster starts absorbing everyone's mana. Yami tells Asta to handle the situation, since he does not have any mana to absorb and because he has an Anti Magic Sword. Asta is hesitant, knowing how hard Charmy must have worked on those dishes. Yami decides to handle it himself, but Asta stops him. Asta charges toward the monster and starts eating it. The part that Asta bit into starts leaking mana back into the air and into the other mages. Charmy joins in the eating as well, not wanting Asta to be the only one who gets to enjoy the food.\nThe other Black Bulls, now rejuvenated, help eat the monster as well, but they all end up fat and tired afterwards. Asta tells Charmy that this food was different from what she normally prepares; normally he can taste the love that she puts into her cooking, but he did not taste it this time. As Asta apologizes for sounding rude, Charmy and Jamo realize they forgot the most important thing about food preparation: making the eater happy with the meal.\nSome other time, Gordon Agrippa tries training with Asta. Although Gordon goes all out, he is easily defeated, which causes him to believe that he is not strong enough to fight alongside his squadmates. He remembers that before making friends with the Black Bulls, being alone helped him to be strong and stay sharp, so he decides to isolate himself. He leaves his collection of Black Bull dolls behind with a note that reads, \"Please don't try to find me.\" As he heads out, he remembers that Mereoleona Vermillion conquered the Grand Magic Zone when she was younger and that helped her to become as strong as she is today. Gordon thinks that a Grand Magic Zone might be too much for him, so instead, he goes to the Forest of Poisonous Magical Beasts.\nAt first, all is going well, until a couple of monkey-like creatures steal his backpack full of provisions. Three days later, Gordon realizes that he is at his limit and decides it is time to return to the base, but he is lost. He makes a campfire and carves new Black Bull dolls out of wood. He starts talking for them and fears that he is going insane. A large purple wolf appears from the shadows. Gordon tries to attack the beast, but his poison does not even bother it. He then gathers up his dolls and runs away.\nGordon manages to find a lake full of clean water and refreshes himself while wondering about how his friends might be missing him at that moment and about the good times they shared. When he hears a noise coming from the bushes, he thinks his friends have come for him. Instead, the wolf from earlier appears with another wolf many times larger that the first, and Gordon quickly realizes that the bigger wolf is the mother. Back at the Black Bulls base, Yami holds up a piece of paper and tells his subordinates that they have to go before it is too late.\nGordon tries attacking the wolves, but his magic still has no effect. The fear of the mother wolf killing him makes him realize that being alone does not make him strong; working with and protecting his friends are the sources of his strength. With this clarity came a second realization: the wolves are actually tame and are just retaliating against his own attacks. He apologizes to them, acknowledging that they are as much citizens of the Clover Kingdom as he is and that attacking them was the worst thing he could do as a Magic Knight. The wolves guide Gordon out of the forest, and Gordon finally realizes that he could not beat them with his magic because they are immune to poison.\nLeaving his wood carvings with the wolves, Gordon returns to the Black Bulls base only to find it empty. Gordon assumes that everyone has gone looking for him and flies out on a broomstick to search for them, intent on rescuing them if need be. However, the Black Bulls are eating at a restaurant that is having a 90% off sale to push excess ingredients. As it turns out, the Black Bulls never saw Gordon's note, or even noticed that he was missing.\n", "In a flashback, in Tolsa village, Zara Ideale is given a flower bouquet from a flower salesman who admires him for his accomplishments as a Magic Knight, Zara appreciates the flowers and says that they are his favorite, though Zara tells him that he should not just give flowers away.\nIn the present, during the time that Yami Sukehiros three pet magical beasts escaped into the woods and the Black Bulls went hunting for them, Zora Ideale was not interested in playing hunter, so he leaves to go train on his own. As he is walking back toward his home town, he thinks that the rest of the squad would just slow him down.\nZora visits his fathers grave to leave a Bouquet of his fathers favorite flower. When he gets there, he notices that there is already a flower bouquet at the grave. Zora wonders who could have left them. Zara was once the pride of Tolsa, but those days are long gone. Zora overhears noise coming from nearby. He goes to investigate and finds a young boy named Ina practicing his Water Magic. Ina is practicing hitting a target with a water blast and Zora was impressed at what Ina is capable of, especially considering that Ina has not yet received his Grimoire.\nA group of young Nobles find Ina practicing and the leader of the group, Kaito hits the target from further away with a fire blast. Zora realizes that they must be out on a country getaway, as there is no other reason for a Noble to be so far out in the boonies. The three Nobles belittle Ina for being a commoner with weak magic. They mock his ambition to join the Magic Knights, believing that only the upper class have strong enough magic to be Magic Knights. Ina responds by telling them that there are plenty of commoners among the Magic Knights ranks already. However the boys dismiss this as said commoners possessing problematic information about the top brass. Ina assured that Zara Ideale got into the Magic Knights fairly, though the three Nobles had no idea who Zara was. When they hear Zara was a member of the Purple Orca squad, they note how the Purple Orcas are the worst squad, and laugh when they hear that Zara died on a mission. Ina tries to defend Zara's honor by attacking the three boys, but Kaito's two friends retaliate with their Earth Magic and Tree Magic. Zora steps in and scares off the three boys with one of his Rainbow Stinkbugs. Zora scolds Ina for picking a fight against such harsh odds, it was three against one and the Nobles all already had their Grimoires.\nIna's father, the same man who gave Zara that flower bouquet all those years ago, comes over to check on his son. Ina complains about having been born a commoner and this angers Zora. Zora carries Ina back to Zara's grave, and after a brief trade of insults, Zora shows Ina the Zora the Supermage doll that Zara made when Zora was a kid. Zora tells Ina that Zara was able to become a Magic Knight because he had something that others did not, though Ina does not know what he means by that.\nIna is seen helping his father tend to the flower fields. Ina's father lets him return to his training. Ina returns to his target practice while Zora sit up overhead in a tree branch. Kaito finds Ina again and demands that Ina apologize for earlier. Ina refuses as he has nothing to apologize for. Kaito reveals that he is in possession of a magic item, bracelet that enhances his magic power. He once again demands that Ina apologize as he activates his magic, though he has a little trouble controlling it. Zora notes that the situation is not good. Kaito loses control of his magic completely an a powerful blast of fire head straight towards Ina. Zora stops the blast and sends it back with his Trap Magic. The flames burn part of Kaito's sleeve and cause him to drop the bracelet. Zora tells Kaito not to get in over his head and Kaito runs away leaving the Magic tool behind, which Ina picks up.\nWhen Ina gets home and has dinner with his father, an angry Noble, Kaito's father, barges in and accuses Ina of stealing his magic tool, which Kaito confirms. Kaito's father finds the bracelet in Ina's possession, but Ina denies having stolen it, stating that he picked it up after Kaito dropped it. Ina's father comes to his sons defense and Kaito's father attacks them with his Fire Magic. Surprisingly, Ina's father is able to handle the flames with his Water Magic. Ina's father states that while he was never able to join the Magic Knights, he never stopped training his magic.\nKaito's father threatens to go to the Magic Knights, but Zora steps in and removes his cloak, revealing his Magic Knight robe. Zora reveals to Kaito's father that he saw Kaito drop the Magic tool earlier. Zora confirms his story by removing Kaito's jacket, revealing the damage that been done earlier. Zora scares Kaito into telling the truth and running away. Kaito's father tries to make a dramatic and elitist exit, but Zora ruins it by threatening him and scaring him away as well. \nThe next morning, Ina says that he finally understands what Zora meant about Zara having a quality that others did not. Ina says goodbye with a handshake, but Zora slipped one if his stinkbugs into Ina's hand.\nAs he is returning to the Black Bulls base, Zora notes that his squad mates would be lost without him.\n", "Late at night in the Black Bulls base, Vanessa Enoteca is in the common area having a late night drink. She thinks about how she and her squad mates need to get stronger for the upcoming war with the Spade Kingdom, and realizes that it does not matter how. As Vanessa is about to leave, she runs into Yami Sukehiro who wishes her luck on her quest.\nVanessa returns to the Witches' Forest and requests that the Witch Queen teach her a special ancient magic. Vanessa tries to explain the upcoming war with Spade, though the Queen reveals that she already knew and expresses insult at Vanessa thinking that she would not know. The Queen agrees to help, but on one condition; magical beasts in the forest are interfering with the security golems, putting the forest at risk if the Spade Kingdom attacks, and tasks Vanessa with getting rid of them. The Queen assigns two other witches to help her, Samantha Kravitz, who is quick to panic, much like Finral Roulacase, and Elvira Aguirre, who is snarky and stubborn, much like Noelle Silva.\nThe three witches find the beasts that have been causing trouble with the golems and Vanessa uses her Thread Magic magic to make a net to hold the beasts back. She tells Samantha and Elvira to attack the bests, but as it turns out, the two witches do not have attack-type magic. After getting away from the beasts, Vanessa questions them about their Magic Attributes. Samantha answers that she uses Sound Magic, which allows her to generate various sounds, and Elvira shows that she can use Illusion Magic, which allows her to create visual illusions.\nVanessa visits the Queen again and tells her that the witches she assigned to help her are useless, then accuses the Queen of giving her an impossible task to make her give up. The Queen responds by asking Vanessa what she can do with her magic.\nVanessa walks through town and runs into Dominante Code, who is selling Magic tools, since her Husband cannot get a job due to being a wanted man. She tries to sell Vanessa a magic washboard that can get any stains out of clothing, Vanessa is not interested, saying that a washboard will not help with her predicament. Dominante argues that everything is good for something and this gives Vanessa an idea.\nThat evening, Vanessa investigates the behavior of the troublesome magical beasts and comes up with a plan. The next morning, Vanessa tells Samantha and Elvira that they were going to relocate the magical beasts to another area where they will not be any trouble. The two witches think that they cannot do it, but Vanessa assures them that they are the only ones who can do. To demonstrate, Vanessa makes some string dolls for a group of three little girls who happen to be passing by. She has Elvira color the dolls to look like the three girls, and has Samantha make voices come from the dolls.\nTo get rid of the large reptilian magical beasts, Vanessa and the others lure them away by creating string dolls that look and sound just like the small squirrel-like magical beasts that the larger beasts prey on. The witches manage to get the beasts to the further away area that Vanessa designed for them, but the real squirrel-like beasts were frightened by the sudden arrival of their predators and hid behind the witches. To scare away the large beasts, Vanessa creates a massive monster-like string doll, has Elvira make the monster look as scary as possible, and has Samantha give the monster a loud roar.\nAfter returning to the witches' forest, the three are swarmed by the rest of the forests witch population and congratulated for their accomplishment. As it turns out, the Witch Queen was broadcasting their exploit for all to see.\nVanessa meets the Queen again and tells her that she no longer needs the unstoppable spell she initially came to learn, saying that her creativity and her ability to make people smile are all that she needs. Before leaving for home, she goes to thank Dominante for the help she indirectly gave, and Dominante replies that if Vanessa is really grateful, then she will buy a magic item that makes bubbles in the bathtub, which Vanessa refuses to do. Dominante laments this, but she has made enough money anyway, noting that the Witch Queen may seem cold, but really does look out for them.\nVanessa returns to the Black Bulls base and finds Captain Yami in the common area having a late night drink. He offers some to Vanessa, but she refuses, believing that it is best for her to keep her senses about her for the time being.\n", "Julius Novachrono, dressed as an ordinary boy, is out exploring the Royal Capital as he usually does. He is found by Marx Francois, who tells him that he needs to return to the office and finish his paperwork. Julius replies that he has already finished today's workload. Julius asks Marx to do some favors for him.\nMarx escorts Sally and Makusa North, a specially-appointed researcher from the Magic Tool Research Lab, to the Black Bulls base. When they arrive, they find Asta training with Noelle Silva, who are both shocked to see Sally out of prison.\nOnce inside the base, Marx explains that Sally has been called on to help develop a mana-increasing magic tool for the upcoming war with the Spade Kingdom. Noelle wants nothing to do with Sally, knowing how crazy she is. Asta on the other hand does not hesitate to remove his shirt and give Sally permission to perform any experiments she wants on him, as that is what he promised her during the Elf Tribe's revival. Sally is ecstatic to finally experiment on Asta, but since her purpose is to develop a mana-enhancement device, she decides to save Asta, who does not have any mana, for last.\nThe rest of the Black Bulls arrive at the base, but once they see Sally, they instantly turn around and make up excuses for why they have to leave. After trapping Marx and Makusa in her Gel Magic, Sally chases after the Black Bulls and injects them with different liquids once she catches them. The liquids cause their magic power to explode and leave them unconscious. Some she catches by luring them with something they cannot resist: a bottle of wine for Vanessa Enoteca and a trail of cupcakes for Charmy Pappitson. Gauche Adlai and Grey try to fight back, but Sally shapes her gel into the shape of Gauche's little sister, Marie Adlai. Gauche refuses to let harm come to anything that even looks like Marie, so they are captured as well.\nFinally, Asta is the only one left. Asta is still intent on keeping his promise to let Sally experiment on him. However, Sally only takes a clipping of his hair and says that the hair is all she needs, although she is tempted to try taking his blood and organs as well. After everyone recovers, Makusa takes Sally's data back to the capital.\nLater on, Marx is assigned to travel with Fuegoleon Vermillion and Nozel Silva to Toaru, a village located in the Forsaken Realm, and investigate bandit trouble that has recently been going on there. At first, they wanted to send a team of their subordinates to deal with the problem, but Julius informs them that the situation is more complicated than that. Before they leave, Julius tells them a special word that they can say to gain the peoples trust. When they arrive, the three wear cloaks as disguises, trying to pass themselves off as nobles who decided to give up the life of luxury, something that has happened in the past.\nThe three Magic Knights discover that the village is still in ruins following the elves' attack. The three split up to try and find out more information about the bandits, though the villagers are wary of them. Fuegoleon says the special word that Julius told them about, Chronovala, which turns out to be the fake name that Julius used whenever he went out in disguise as an old woman. Once the villagers learned that they are friends of Chronovala, they immediately become friendly and hospitable to the strangers. Marx is amazed at how Julius is able to earn peoples respect, even when they do not know that it's him.\nThat night, the bandits attack the Magic Knights in the house that villagers let them stay in. Nozel and Fuegoleon take them down easily and discover that the bandits are none other than the impoverished villagers themselves. They finally understand what Julius meant when he said the situation was complicated. The two royal captains decide to overlook the attack if the villagers atone by helping other villages, and additional Magic Knights are sent to aid the reconstruction effort.\n", "Years ago in Hage, a young Asta told a young Yuno that they are family, and even though they are not related by blood, they are closer than most people who are. Asta told Yuno that while they may not have blood family, they do have friends, and that they should make all of their friends part of their family, to which Yuno agreed.\nIn the present, at the Golden Dawn base, Yuno, Mimosa Vermillion, and Klaus Lunettes are returning from a mission from Kiten and are about to give their report to Captain William Vangeance. When they arrive, they meet Siren Tium, Hamon Caseus, Letoile Becquerel, David Swallow, and Alecdora Sandler, who are also about to give their mission reports. Alecdora can only think of how much he is disgusted by Yuno, thinking of the young mage as arrogant for his claims of one day becoming the Magic Emperor and how he became even worse following his accomplishments during the elves' attack. Alecdora believes that if he had not been possessed, then he could have been useful to William.\nThe group enters the chamber where William is waiting for them, and while they enter, Klaus tells Yuno that it would benefit him to be a little friendlier. William congratulates the Magic Knights on their recent success, and even though he realizes they must be tired from their recent exploits, assigns the eight Knights another mission to deal with a herd of wild boars that have been causing trouble out near Sosshi, as no other Knights are available at the time. Alecdora volunteers to deal with the boars himself, but Langris Vaude warns them that these boars are actually magical beasts covered in flames. William names Alecdora the leader of the mission.\nOnce they arrive at Sosshi, the villagers are delighted that the Golden Dawn have come to their aid, though Nick and Anna wish it had been the Black Bulls who answered their call for help, as they want to see Asta again. This reminds the Knights that it was there in Sosshi where the Eye of the Midnight Sun was first seen several months ago. The villagers confirm that the boars are indeed covered in flames and that they are even more aggressive than the last time they had been causing problems.\nThe Knights head out into the forest to deal with the boars. Alecdora orders them to split up and take out the beasts; however, Yuno suggests that they should investigate why the boars are behaving so aggressively, so as to prevent the problem from happening again. Alecdora refuses to take orders from Yuno and tells him to do his plan on his own. After the Knights defeat several boars, Yuno notices purple smudges around the boars' mouths, and Mimosa discovers the location of the purple fruits that the boars have been eating, which are what have been causing the boars to become so volatile. Yuno and Klaus clear out all of the trees.\nThe villagers are grateful that the Knights stopped the boars and even got rid of the source of the problem. Since the boars are less aggressive, the villagers keep some of the tamer boars as pets. Nick and Anna ask Yuno to pass on a message to Asta: they have been working on their spells so that they can one day join the Magic Knights and work alongside him once he is the Magic Emperor. Yuno agrees to pass on the message but tells them that the next Magic Emperor is going to be him, not Asta.\nWhen the team returns to their base, William sends them out on another mission to a new dungeon near Kiten that has been occupied by suspicious people. Spade Kingdom soldiers were seen fighting in the area. William notes that the situation is dire, but he cannot go himself. He asks Langris to take the lead this time, but Langris is still waiting for his injuries to heal. William puts Alecdora in charge again instead. After the Knights leave, Langris questions if Alecdora is really the wisest option to lead the mission, noting that Yuno might have been a better choice. William replies that Langris is different these days and wants Alecdora to change for the better as well.\nWhen the Knights arrive at the dungeon, they find a group of bandits, instead of the Spade Kingdom soldiers that they had feared. After Alecdora restrains the bandits standing guard outside the dungeon, they split into two teams: Alecdora, Siren, Hamon, and Letoile enter from the front, while Klaus, Mimosa, David, and Yuno enter through the top, racing to see who will reach the treasure room first. The Knights deal with the bandits scattered within the dungeon fairly easily, but a few of them are notably strong due to their magic being enhanced by magic tools. Both teams reach the central treasure room at the same time, much to Alecdora's disdain.\nInside the treasure room, they find Gepard, the former Senior Magic Knight who hired the bandits. He notes that he should not have expected too much from a bunch of low level bandits, even with the magic tools he gave them. He then notes that his own magic tool, a pendant necklace, is far more powerful than what he gave to the bandits. Alecdora attacks with his Sand-Armored Heavy Guard, but Gepard's Black Earth Magic allows him to take over Alecdora's Sand Magic and turn it back against the Golden Dawn. The others Knights attack, but Gepard has a second magic tool, an urn which sucks in spells no matter how powerful they are, even Spirit Magic. Gepard claims that the urn is the greatest treasure hidden in the dungeon. Despite the strength of these two magic items, the Knights refuse to back down. They continue their attacks and destroy the floor beneath Gepard's feet. Sylph flies in and grabs the magic-sucking urn. Alecdora attacks again, but this time, hidden inside of the spell is Yuno's Towering Tornado, which defeats Gepard and strips him of the magic necklace.\nThey return the their base, and during the debriefing, Alecdora praises Yuno and the others while Yuno defends Alecdora's leadership. Alecdora notes that when Yuno first joined the Golden Dawn, many members looked down on him for his low status as a peasant, and Alecdora himself was no exception. Klaus also confesses to thinking of peasants as being useless, but realized his mistake after his life was saved by Asta, a peasant with no magic. Alecdora apologizes to Yuno, though Yuno does not know what he is apologizing for. Alecdora says that he does not expect him to understand and that he simply could not let the apology go unsaid, though Alecdora still adamantly refuses to accept Yuno as a true member of the Golden Dawn. \nAfterward, the others invite Yuno to have dinner with them. Yuno remembers Asta's words from when they were children about making their friends family.\n", "Before the elves' attack on the Clover Kingdom, in the Common Realm town of Tiulyu, Dazu Tayak receives medical treatment from Bow Nocde, the town's doctor. Bow offers to let Dazu stay longer, and though Dazu really wants to stay, she acknowledges that she should be getting home soon and begins the walk back to her house. That night, Dazu makes dinner for her husband, Vide, and mother-in-law, Meshu. When Meshu's soup gets cold, Dazu offers to heat it up in the kitchen, but Meshu tells Dazu to use her Catalyst Magic instead. Dazu complies and borrows Vide's Spatial Magic and Meshu's Fire Magic, allowing her to easily heat up the soup. As her family is expressing their envy over her magic attribute, the elves' attack begins and the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base passes over Tiulyu, dropping rubble everywhere. A group of possessed Purple Orcas attack the town. In the destruction, Vide and Meshu are trapped under the rubble. Dazu tries to free them but is unable to do so. Later on, one of the possessed Magic Knights approaches Dazu and is about to kill her, but is stopped by the mass exorcism.\nA few days later, while the people of Tiulyu begin reconstruction of their town, Dazu places flowers at the graves of her husband and mother-in-law. Bow walks up to her and shows her a newspaper that reports the scapegoat story about Asta and Secre Swallowtail being servants of devils and being behind the attack. The revelation drives Dazu to tears.\nAfter the meeting between Julius Novachrono, Damnatio Kira, and the Magic Knight Captains, in which it was decided that the verdict of Asta and Secre's trial would be postponed for six months, Damnatio is confronted by Kabwe Carillon, a guard who works for the Magic Parliament. Kabwe is furious with the postponement, due to losing his nephew in the attack, and demands that justice be served. Damnatio tells him that there are many factors at work and that the best option for the time being is to work with the Magic Knights and Heart Kingdom to fight the Spade Kingdom and its devil, as such it is best to let Asta and Nero have a temporary reprieve. When Kabwe continues to object, Damnatio simply orders him to be silent. As Kabwe walks through the Royal Capital, thinking that the scales of justice have tipped toward darkness, he is approached by Dazu and Bow, who explain the plight that they have suffered at the hands of devils and tell him that they seek to recruit other like-minded citizens on a mission of vengeance. Kabwe is interested and asks to hear more details.\nAt the Black Bulls base, Asta and Noelle Silva are training. Noelle wants to stop for a drink of water, though Asta is not thirsty. As Noelle goes in for a drink, Asta decides to do some physical training. Inside the base, Gauche Adlai and Finral Roulacase enter through one of Finral's portals. They join Noelle for some water. Gauche decides to go visit his little sister Marie Adlai, but wants to clean himself off first. Back outside, Asta makes it to 1,000 sit-ups and Noelle decides to make him a sandwich.\nIn the town of Nairn, a team of Devil Banishers, the anti-devil vigilantes, arrive to kidnap Marie. The other children try to stop them and one of the nearby townspeople goes for help. He tries to call out Sister Theresa Rapual, but she is away at a meeting of nuns, so Neige steps into the fray himself and blasts them with snow. A barrier protects the vigilantes, while Neige is ambushed and taken down. As the townspeople are coming to help, the vigilantes tie up the children and take Marie. As they leave, Marie calls out for Gauche to come save her.\nBack at the Black Bulls base, Gauche thinks he hears an angel call out to him and tells Finral to take him to Marie, telling his fellow Knight that he would be there for a while. Outside, Secre asks Asta how long he plans to continue doing sit-ups, to which Asta replies that he plans to go to 10,000, though he loses count and starts over to ensure that his workout does not end early. Disguised, Bow stumbles out from the nearby bushes and pretends to be hurt. Asta and Secre, who changes to her human form, go over to check on her, but once they get close, Bow knocks them out with a powerful sedative gas. The Devil Banishers briefly celebrate their accomplishment of capturing the servants of devils and take note of Secre's horns, identifying them as a sign that she had used Forbidden Magic. They try to secure Asta and Secre, but they are surprised to find that Asta can still move. Secre uses her Sealing Magic to take the tracking bracelet which had been placed on him as part of the arrangement for his trial verdict being postponed.\nNoelle Silva intervenes, but before she could do any significant damage, one Banisher uses Flower on the Roadside to whack Noelle's wand out of her hand, and another uses Sandscreen to temporarily blind her. The vigilantes run away with Asta and Secre over their shoulders, but Noelle chases after them with her Valkyrie Dress spell. She manages to make them drop Asta, but they escape after one of them uses Permeation Magic, successfully kidnapping Secre. As Noelle tries to wake Asta, Gauche and Finral arrive in Nairn where the children inform them that Marie was kidnapped, which angers Gauche.\n", "Kabwe Carillon's team of Devil Banishers returns to Bow Nocde's house in Tiulyu with an unconscious Secre Swallowtail in tow. They report to the other team about their failure to capture Asta, but that he would not wake up for a long time.\nGordon Agrippa and Noelle Silva take Asta to Owen, who confirms that Asta is still alive just sleeping. Noelle asks why Asta has not woken up yet and worries that the Devil Banishers might have used a spell that makes him sleep forever. Owen confirms that Asta actually is not under a spell. Yami Sukehiro drags Marx Francois into the room. Marx expresses annoyance at Yami's actions, stating that he would have come anyway and did not need to be dragged. Noelle asks Owen about what he meant when he said that Asta was not under a spell. Yami demands that Owen not say some stupid clich\u00e9 about it being a sleeping potion, but Owen confirms that it is a sleeping potion and a very strong one. Owen states that Asta would wake up soon and Yami deduced that the enemies did not want to kill him, since the just tried to put him to sleep. Marx begins to search through Asta's memory of the attack.\nMeanwhile, in Nairn, Gauche Adlai threatens Sister Theresa for allowing Marie Adlai to fall into danger a third time; the time she had been taken by Neige and Baro, the time she had been taken to trial by the Magic Parliament, and now being taken by the Devil Banishers. Finral Roulacase tries to talk Gauche down from hurting the nun, but Gauche just shouts at him to shut up. Theresa apologizes for being away and points out that Gauche could be doing something more productive to find his sister than strangling an old lady. Neige wakes up and Gauche questions him about what happened. Neige tells him about the Devil Banishers and repeats their message about the scales tipping toward darkness.\nBack with Owen, Marx, and the other Black Bulls, they are viewing the last of Asta's memory from before he lost consciousness. Noelle noted that the spells the Devil Banishers used did not seem very powerful. She assumed that they were trying to keep a low profile so that the rest of the Black Bull squad did not come help. Yami breaks a hole in the wall and announces that the Devil Banishers have made the biggest mistake of their lives.\nIn Clover Castle, Gauche and Finral barge into the office of the Magic Parliament chairman Damnatio Kira, blasting a hole in the wall, thinking he was behind the Devil Banishers due to their reference to the scales of justice. When Damnatio shrinks Gauche's mirror, Gauche's Real Double flies in from outside and forces Damnatio's hand off the scale. Damnatio then forces Gauche and Finral to their knees and orders his guards to seize them, but Yami barges into the office, breaking another wall.\nYami scolds Gauche for going rogue and for taking Finral. Gauche accuses Damnatio of being responsible for the Devil Banishers and Damnatio asks Marx to search his memories to prove his innocence. Marx's magic shows that Damnatio had nothing to do with the kidnappings and Damnatio wishes to punish Gauche for accusing him of a serious crime he did not commit. Gauche is fine with being punished but demands that it wait until after he saves his little sister. Yami notes that the guard from Damnatio's memories is absent, believing that all the ruckus should have brought him there. A call comes in from Julius Novachrono on Marx's communication device, saying that he had something important being delivered to them and that it should be arriving at any moment. Nozel Silva enters the office with a magic tool that shows the signal from Asta's monitor bracelet, which had appeared in Tiulyu in the Common Realm. Yami quickly figures out that Secre removed it from Asta so that she could be tracked. Yami and Gauche tell Finral to open a portal, but Finral has never been to Tiulyu and therefore cannot open a portal to that town.\nJulius over the communication device states that the Black Bulls are still on a mission to monitor Secre and that they cannot do so until she is rescued, convincing Damnatio that Gauche's punishment should be delayed. Julius reminds them to be careful due to all the unknowns involved in the situation. Nozel agrees to go with the Black Bulls to rescue Secre and Marie. They fly through the sky toward Tiulyu on Nozel's giant mercury eagle. Noelle asks her brother why he came with them when he could be training with the rest of his squad. He states that they need every able body they can get in the upcoming war and that he does not want to lose anyone until then. Yami claims that Nozel was just worried about Noelle and that he should stop trying to act cool. Nozel angrily threatens to let Yami fall to his death.\nOnce they arrive near Tiulyu, the signal from the bracelet starts to fail, due to the Banishers placing anti-tracking cuffs on Secre's wrists. Finral complains about how far away they landed. Noelle scolds him for not considering that they do not fully know what they are up against. Yami asks Gauche if he has a picture of Marie that they can show to the towns people, of which he has many. They split up into teams of two: Gauche with Gordon, Nozel with Noelle, and Yami with Finral, and they all head into town. They wonder why nobody has come to help the village in its reconstruction efforts.\nDazu Tayak is visiting her husband's and mother-in-law's graves when she sees Yami and Finral, who talk about how many of the graves were from the elves' attack.\n", "Dazu Tayak is visiting her husband's and mother-in-law's graves, remembering the good times she shared with them. She sees Yami Sukehiro and Finral Roulacase, who talk about how many of the graves were from the elves' attack. They approach Dazu and ask her if she has seen Marie Adlai or Secre Swallowtail and she replies that she has not. Yami asks her if she knows of anyone with a grudge against devils. She tells them that everyone has a grudge against devils and asks them if they had heard about how a devil was responsible for the resent attack. She recognizes them as Magic Knight due to their cloaks and asked why they did not come to help. Yami takes responsibility and apologizes.\nIn another part of town, the villagers are surprised to see members of the royal House Silva. Noelle Silva tries to question the villagers if they had seen Marie or Secre, but they would not give her the time of day. Nozel Silva deduces that the townspeople are bitter about how so many of the Magic Knights were possessed during the attack and that no one came to help them. Nozel decides to keep a level head and suggests that they try something else.\nGauche Adlai is running through town in search of his little sister. He thinks he sees her and runs to hug her, but it turns out to be a different girl entirely. Gordon Agrippa tries though comfort the girl by giving her a lollipop, but she gets scared by Gordon's ghoulish face. Gordon tells Gauche that he needs to be more careful, but Gauche adamantly states that he will do everything in his power to save Marie if he thinks he sees her, no matter how small the chance that it is actually her. Gauche shouts Marie's name to the heavens, getting the attention of an old woman named Maggie, who thought he was calling her.\nDazu makes her way back to Bow Nocde's house, keeping to the shadows along the way. Once there, Dazu and Bow descend into the basement where the Devil Banishers are waiting for them. Dazu informs them that the Magic Knights are in town and they discover that Secre is in possession of the magic tracker bracelet that was placed on Asta. They are about to break it, but Dazu has an idea.\nThe Magic Knights reconvene outside of town and report to each other that they had found nothing. The magic item used to track Asta's bracelet shows the signal moving away. Nozel, Noelle, Gauche, and Finral chase after the tracker, while Yami and Gordon stay put and take another look around town just in case. Back in Bow's basement, the Banishers discuss how the Magic Knights have betrayed the ideals of justice. The Magic Parliament guards want to kill Marie and Secre immediately, but Dazu believes that the Banishers should keep them alive for now and use them to lure out Asta, which they agree to.\nNozel's group follow the tracker to the ruins of a far off town and discover the tracker around the neck of a bird.\nIn Bow's house, Bow tells Dazu that without her, she would have no purpose in life, and Dazu replies that she would otherwise fall into the depth of despair.\nBack in the Royal Capital, Asta finally wakes up. He remembers what happened and tries to go save Secre, but is stopped by the arrival of Captain Yami, who tells him that he should not go before hearing about what has been going on while he was asleep. After hearing about the situation and that the sleeping potion has been purged from his system, Asta wants to head out immediately, but Yami reminds him that they have no information about their location and tells them to return to the Black Bulls base instead.\nA meeting is held consisting of the Magic Emperor, Julius Novachrono, the Magic Parliament chairman, Damnatio Kira, and five of the Magic Knight Captains, Yami, Nozel, Fuegoleon Vermillion, Jack the Ripper, and Charlotte Roselei. The other Captains are absent because the Golden Dawn and Aqua Deer squads are handling border patrol while the Coral Peacock and Purple Orca squads are helping with the kingdom's reconstruction. Damnatio tells them about his subordinates Kabwe Carillon who uses Permeation Magic, Onoby Sinho who uses Barrier Magic, and Siona Caverly who uses Paper Magic. Jack claims that he could take down all of them by himself, but the other Captains remind him that saving the hostages takes priority, especially since Secre is an Arcane Stage Mage, and therefore vital in the upcoming war with the Spade Kingdom.\nFuegoleon finds it hard to believe that the Banishers were able to beat Asta, and Yami informs them that they used trickery, putting Asta in a situation that he is not used to, as he has only had to deal with direct combat before. The Magic Knights assume that the Banishers have an excellent strategist among their ranks. Jack questions why the Banishers have not killed their prisoners yet, and Damnatio assumes it is because Kabwe wants to do a public execution to get the people on their side. Julius reminds them that they are preparing for war and cannot afford an internal crisis at this point. He tells them to tread cautiously, as he feels that a piece of the puzzle is missing.\nIn the town of Lehart, a message from the Devil Banishers was written on a wall, stating that the servants of the devil would be executed at noon that day.\n", "Marie Adlai wakes up in a strange place surrounded by the Devil Banishers and remembers the kidnapping. She recognizes Secre Swallowtail as a friend of Asta and Gauche Adlai and asks her if she knew the kidnappers, to which she replies that she does not. Secre deduced that the only connection she had to Marie was that they were both put on trial for being servants of the devil. Upstairs, Kabwe Carillon, Dazu Tayak, and Bow Nocde are speaking of how justice will be served.\nLater on, in the city of Lehart, a large crowd has turned up to witness the death of the servants of the devil. Various squads of the Magic Knights are hidden in the shadows of nearby buildings. Julius Novachrono contacts them and informs them that the Silver Eagle and Crimson Lion squads will protect the civilians in the crowd, the Green Mantis and Blue Rose squads will secure the perimeter, and the Black Bull squad will confront the Devil Banishers themselves. Yami Sukehiro complains about Damnatio Kira being along for the mission due to his subordinates being responsible for the situation. Damnatio tells Asta to avoid using his devil power, lest he cause an uproar. Marx Francois informs Julius that the other squads are guarding the Noble Realm, just in case the execution is actually a distraction for something else.\nThe Black Bulls, with the exceptions of Asta, Gauche, and Yami, spread out through the crowd and wonder how they can locate the Banishers in a crowd full of people who are shouting for the death of the devil. Vanessa Enoteca is approached by a pair of Banishers who tell her to leave or else the hostages will be killed immediately. Vanessa agrees to leave with them, believing that her squad mates will be able to handle things.\nAt the stroke of noon, the Devil Banishers still have not shown up, but they then appear with their prisoners as Kabwe undoes his Permeation Magic spell. Nozel Silva realizes that the Banishers are wearing bracelets that hide their magic power from being sensed, but Fuegoleon Vermillion notices that only three Banishers are wearing them. Kabwe announces that the two girls on stage are servants of the devil and are to be executed for their crimes against the Clover Kingdom. He then calls out to Asta and offers to let Secre and Marie go free if Asta turns himself in.\nAt first there is no response, so the Banishers decide to execute the girls. Asta responds to the call and walks through the crowd, who insult him and express their hatred. As a Banisher is about to take his grimoire, a second Asta appears above the Banishers with the Demon-Dweller Sword drawn and the Black Bulls charge in. The first Asta transforms back into Grey and Asta nullifies the Barrier Magic around the Banishers. One of the Banishers throws a potion, so Asta retreats in case it is another sleeping potion. Finral Roulacase then opens a portal to try and save the hostages, but Siona Caverly drives him off with Dagger-Folding Early Summer Rain. The other Magic Knight squads and the Banishers in the crowd join the fight.\nThe Devil Banishers decide to retreat and Asta chases after them. The rest of the Black Bulls are held up by a smoke that disrupts mana. The Magic Knights defeat some of the Banishers fairly easily.\nIn another part of town, Vanessa asks her captors where they are leading her, to which they respond that they are not taking her to any specific place. They simply wanted to remove her from the battlefield because of her ability to change fate. Vanessa believes that enough time has passed that her squad mates will have already saved the hostages and decides to fight the two Banishers. The Banishers admit that they cannot beat a Magic Knight, and knowing that the Magic Knights read the memories of prisoners, they release a potion that causes both of them to be incinerated. Vanessa wonders what plan could possibly be worth them sacrificing their lives so casually.\nAsta confronts the Banishers, who threaten to kill Secre and Marie if he does not surrender and hand over his grimoire. Asta complies and allows them to put a set of handcuffs on him after placing his grimoire on the ground. Kabwe wants to kill him immediately, but the other Banishers oppose this idea. Asta tries to fight back and manages to get Marie, but Siona corners him and attacks him with her paper blades, reminding him that if he dodges, the blades will hit Marie. Asta is saved by the arrival of Yuno, Klaus Lunettes, and Mimosa Vermillion. The Devil Banishers retreat, taking Secre and Asta's grimoire. Yuno says that it does not matter that Asta does not have his grimoire because that is not where his magic comes from. Asta breaks his cuffs and states that his true magic is never giving up.\nLater on in the Royal Capital, Marie is resting in Owen's office. Gauche rushes in and begs Marie not to die, but Asta confirms that she is just sleeping, much to Gauche's relief. Gauche says that he is once again in debt to Asta.\nIn the meeting room, Damnatio apologizes to the Magic Knight Captains for his subordinates who are now confirmed to be with the Devil Banishers. William Vangeance suspects that the Banishers might be under the manipulation of an unknown party who might want Asta's grimoire. Julius informs them that the memories they searched through from the Banishers they captured revealed that the group is mostly made up of hired help. A guard enters and delivers a message from Kabwe; in a panicked voice, Kabwe tells the Magic Knights that the Devil Banishers were a fraud and were in fact devil worshippers who want to gain the devil's power, the \"Devil Believers\".\n", "In Bow Nocde's basement, Siona Caverly is writhing in pain due to injuries that she suffered from the Golden Dawn's intervention. Bow offers to prepare some pain medication, with Kabwe Carillon agreeing that she should. After Siona takes the medicine and is told that the pain will soon subside, Kabwe and Onoby Sinho have a drink of water. Kabwe pulls out his grimoire and states that he plans to execute Secre Swallowtail. Dazu Tayak tries to stop him by reminding him that they have more important things to deal with. Kabwe states that the five-leaf grimoire that they took from Asta needs to be dealt with too. Dazu tries to argue, but Kabwe believes that the book is of no further use. Secre says that she does not care what happens to her and pleads with the Devil Banishers to return the book to Asta. Kabwe compliments the nobility of her request, but argues that her words mean nothing since she is tainted by the devil's evil.\nSiona starts screaming and clutching her chest and then suddenly dies. Onoby then collapses and dies as well, much to Kabwe's horror. Kabwe starts to feel sick and drops the five-leaf grimoire. He realizes that there was something in the water that Bow brought them earlier. He asks why the Banishers decided to betray them. Dazu picks up the five-leaf grimoire and reveals to him the groups true intentions: They are actually the Devil Believers, and instead of wanting to destroy the devil as they originally claimed, they worship the devil and seek to gain devil power for their own. Dazu reveals that they were taking advantage of the hatred that Kabwe, Onoby, and Siona felt towards the devil and were just using them for their knowledge as members of the Magic Parliament and their strong magical abilities.\nKabwe does not understand what Dazu means when she says they needed people who could actually use magic. Dazu notes that it must be hard for someone like him to understand that there are people in the world who are hated by mana. She tells him a story about when she was a child and used her Catalyst Magic to combine the Wind Magic and Water Magic of two of her friends, creating a cool rain shower to cool them off on a hot day. They seemed happy, and that made her happy, but she later overheard her friends talking about her behind her back, insulting her because she has so little magic power. Dazu tells Kabwe that people like the Devil Believers have no place in the Clover Kingdom, something that they have all been told since they were children. Dazu states that the Believers wish to become like Asta, who was able to become a strong and well known Magic Knight using a grimoire that granted him the power of a devil. Kabwe declares that he will stop them, but is stabbed by one of the Believers and collapses.\nThe Believers take Secre and leave Kabwe to die, but he is determined not to let things end like that. He contacts the Magic Knights and informs Damnatio Kira, the nine Captains, and the Magic Emperor of the Believers' true intentions before dropping dead. With this new information, Julius Novachrono deduces that Kabwe, Onoby, and Siona were ignorant of the groups true nature. Marx Francois enters the meeting room and informs the Magic Knights that the communication was traced to Tiulyu. Julius orders the Black Bulls to travel there and deal with the Believers.\nOnce the Black Bulls arrive at Bow's basement, they find the three dead Magic Parliament guards, and with no signs of their death being the result of an internal conflict, they concluded that the three guards truly were in the dark about the Devil Believers. Gordon Agrippa notices that the shelves in the house are filled with rare medicine ingredients. Gordon deduces that the potions that the Believers used had been made by whoever lived in the house. Yami Sukehiro wants to get more information on the owner of the house, but notes that information gathering could be difficult, due to the townspeople being wary of the Magic Knights.\nGordon takes them to see Maggie, an old woman in the town whom he befriended during the initial search for the Devil Banishers. Maggie asks about Gauche Adlai, to whom she had taken a liking. Gordon tells her that he is back in the Capital, looking after his little sister. Maggie tells them about Bow, the town doctor. Since Bow was an expert at making medicine, the townspeople went to her instead of healing mages, though she has very little magic power. It is precisely because of her lack of magic that Bow put so much effort into her pharmaceutical practice. Maggie also tells them about Bow's good friend Dazu, who lost both her husband and mother-in-law during the elves' attack.\nThe Black Bulls search through the wreckage of Dazu's house, where Finral Roulacase finds Dazu and Vide's wedding picture. Yami recognizes her as the woman they met at the cemetery. Noelle Silva believes that there is something not right about the picture; despite Maggie going on and on about how happy Dazu and Vide were together, Dazu had a dead look on her face. Yami wonders why someone who lost their family to a devil would become a devil worshipper.\nThe Black Bulls report back to Julius and he deduces that with the information they acquired from Magic Parliament guards, the Believers know about Megicula being in the Spade Kingdom. Yami deduces that the Believers want to give Secre and the five-leaf grimoire, probably Asta as well, as tributes to the devil in exchange for granting them power. Julius orders the Black Bulls to head toward the border. Before reaching Spade, the Believers would have to pass through the Forsaken Realm.\nFinral goes to collect Gauche, who initially does not want to leave Marie, but Theresa Rapual convinces him to go by reminding him that he should think about what would make Marie happy. The Black Bulls head toward the Forsaken Realm in the The Raging Black Bull. The other Magic Knight squads spread out to search the Common Realm, in case they are wrong about the Believers' course of action. After several days of diligent searching, the Magic Knights find nothing. Julius believes that by this point, the Devil Believers are past the Forsaken Realm and are heading toward the Spade Kingdom's border. Yami reports that multiple people from various villages that they have searched just suddenly left.\nAsta, Noelle, and Magna Swing overhear a boy arguing with his mother. The boy wants to join the Believers march to the Spade Kingdom and get devil power, but his mother thinks it is a bad idea. The boy's father tries to stop him, but the boy is determined to get to the meeting place outside of town. Asta, Noelle, and Magna ride Crazy Cyclone to where they believe the meeting place would most likely be. They do not see any people, but do find footprints, confirming that they were still on the Believers' trail. Asta, Noelle, and Magna realize that the people who have gone missing from the towns are all desperate people who see the Believers' ideology of the devil granting power as a ray of hope. The three mages ride toward Breed Mountain, which stands at the edge of the Clover Kingdom. Yami informs them that the mountain has strong mana and therefore volatile weather and that the Believers will likely be slowed down to wait out the storms. The three Magic Knights fly through the raging storm and Noelle catches sight of the Devil Believers trekking along the mountain path. The Believers have been joined by several hundred citizens.\n", "Some time ago, Dazu Tayak watching the sunset from a bridge when Bow Nocde passed by and commented on how lovely the view was. Dazu recognized Bow as the woman whom her mother-in-law told her about. Bow guessed that Meshu had warned Dazu to avoid her. Dazu denied this and asked Bow where she learned to make medicine. Bow replied that she learned through study and trial and error. Bow admitted that she did not have much magic, so she found the one thing she could do and stuck with it. Bow was about to leave when Dazu introduced herself and asked if she could visit with Bow sometime. Bow agreed and even offered to teach Dazu a bit about medicine making.\nIn the present, a storm is raging on Breed Mountain and the Devil Believers continue their difficult trek through the rain. They use some of Bow's explosive potions to clear the path as they go. They want hurry and get across the border before it gets too dark. Once they cross the border out of the Clover Kingdom, the Magic Knights will not be able to stop them, even if they catch up to them, as they will be outside of the Magic Knights' jurisdiction. Secre Swallowtail tells them that even if they make it out of Clover, they will never be able to reach the Spade Kingdom because of the treacherous Grand Magic Zone between the two kingdoms. Secre questions how they plan to get across with almost no magical abilities when such a task would be difficult and dangerous even for a powerful Magic Knight. The Believers acknowledge that there is a very real possibility that they might die, but resolve that just having even a small chance of making it is enough, and they continue onward.\nIn another area of the Mountain, Magna Swing tries to get in contact with Yami Sukehiro and reports that his team found the Devil Believers who have gained more followers; however, the unstable mana in the area is interfering with the signal. Magna rides off on his broom, Crazy Cyclone, to find a spot with better reception after he tells Asta and Noelle Silva to stay put so he can find them again when he returns with reinforcements. Asta immediately tries to climb up the cliff side to confront the Devil Believers. Noelle flies up after him with her Valkyrie Dress and scolds him for running off after being told to stay put. Asta replies that he is worried about Nero, which Noelle understands, but she still believes that they need a plan. Asta claims he can talk to them so they can understand each other, though Noelle thinks that will not be that easy. Seeing that Asta is still as stubborn as ever, she offers to let Asta hold onto her so she can fly him up, which he accepts.\nThe Believers are having a hard time getting through the harsh conditions on the Mountain, but continue on, believing that a little bad weather is nothing compared to the way they have suffered in the past. Bow and Dazu take a moment to admire the sunset. As they continue on, they notice that it is a full moon, meaning the chaotic mana of the Neutral Zone between Clover and Spade will be weaker than normal, giving them a better chance, even if the odds are still against them. Dazu thanks Bow for all that she had done for her.\nNoelle and Asta catch up to the Devil Believers by air and Asta drops down between the original Believers and the numerous people who joined them later on. Noelle notices that the people have such little magic power and wonders how many more there could be in the world. Noelle warns Asta to be careful, but he is not worried about them using any potions because the wind is too strong. When the Believers' followers step forward, Noelle readies herself to fight them, but to her surprise, they bow down to Asta, since he has been bestowed with the power of a devil, which they worship. Asta demands that they return Secre and tells them that he knows of their plan to offer Secre and the five-leaf grimoire to the Spade Kingdom. He warns that they will not all make it through the Neutral Zone with so many people, even with the Grand Magic Zone being weakened by the full moon. The Believers know this, but they still resolve to press on.\nDazu admits that she has little magic power and was constantly looked down on and ridiculed by everyone around her, something she believes Asta can understand. Asta reminds her of her husband and mother-in-law, but Dazu confesses that she was never happy with them and cries that they were just using her to make themselves feel superior. Dazu collapses to her knees and cries that she is happy that they are now dead. Bow helps Dazu back to her feet and tells Asta about how she is able to create medicine with effects superior to the power of the average healing mage, but has always been looked down on for her lack of magic. Though the details differ from person to person, all of the Devil Believers and the hundreds of followers who joined them have all had similar experiences. Bow admits that she had no idea that there would be so many people who wanted to join them, and Dazu condemns Asta for having the nerve to ask them to return to the misery that they are trying to leave behind. Asta tells them that he understands their pain, but that is exactly why he has to stop them.\nNoelle asks what they want in the Spade Kingdom, to which they respond that they want to gain power from the devil that Kabwe Carillon told them about. After obtaining devil power, they want to return to Clover and seek revenge. Dazu holds up Asta's grimoire and recites the saying about five-leaf clovers. Dazu and Bow confess their admiration for Asta, who even though had no mana, was still able to achieve great things as a Magic Knight because he obtained the power of the devil through a five-leaf grimoire. Asta tells them that he is different from them: Even after obtaining the power of the devil, he never once thought about taking revenge because he wants everyone to be happy, no matter their status. Dazu wishes that they could see the world the way he does, but their hatred cannot be stopped. The Believers refuse to release Secre and intend to continue to Spade. Asta offers to take Secre's place. The Believers agree and Asta and Noelle agree to let the Believers restrain them. However, the Believers go back on their word and still refuse to release Secre. They believe that the devil in Spade will be pleased with offering of a devil host, his five-leaf grimoire, a user of Forbidden Magic, and a Clover Kingdom royal.\nThey continue on their journey until they reach the border, where Noelle can feel the overwhelming mana ahead. Secre questions how they intend to make it across the Grand Magic Zone. Dazu replies that they will use her Catalyst Magic to unify and utilize the minor amounts of magic from all of their followers to push through the Neutral Zone. Secre argues that there is too much distance to cover and no guarantee that their magic will hold out the whole way. Dazu admits it is a major gamble, but at least one person might make it and obtain the devil's power. As they set out, Magna and Yami land on the path ahead of them.\n", "Some time ago, Dazu Tayak paid a visit to Bow Nocde. Dazu was impressed by all the medicines that Bow had made, but Bow denied that they were anything special. Dazu respectfully disagreed and Bow thanked her. Bow demonstrated to Dazu how she uses her magic to mix her herbs and admitted that that was about all she could do with her magic, but Dazu told her that it was something she should be proud of. Later that evening, Dazu went home after making plans with Bow to pay her another visit in the future. At another point in the past, Bow was showing Dazu the proper way to mix medicine. She left Dazu to continue mixing while she went to grab one final ingredient, but then had to correct Dazu's mixing technique, as she had been mixing too fast and rough. During a past winter, Bow and Dazu were sitting by the fireplace while trying on lip moisturizing cream. Later on, Dazu came to Bow for medical treatment for the scar on her arm. When Bow asked how she got it, Dazu stated that it was the people who look down on her for having little magic power. Bow told her to be strong while she bandaged the wound. Dazu thought about how she had always felt alone, but realized that she was not.\nIn the present, up on Breed Mountain, close to border between the Clover Kingdom and the Neutral Zone, Yami Sukehiro and Magna Swing are blocking the path of the Devil Believers. Noelle Silva questions what took them so long to arrive and Asta is surprised to see that Captain Yami is the backup. Yami explains that he was able to get there the fastest. Yami takes notice of the Devil Believers followers and admits there are more than he thought there would be. The followers recognize Yami as a Captain of the Magic Knights and wonder if he is there to arrest them. The Devil Believers and their followers refuse to accept this and decide to ignore him and continue on to the Spade Kingdom.\nThe Believers try to drag Asta and Noelle along, but Asta uses his immense brute strength to get himself, Noelle, and Secre Swallowtail free from the Believer that was holding them. The Believers are about to go after them, but Dazu tells them that it is not important, since the still have Asta's five-leaf Grimoire. Asta carries the two girls over to Yami, who uses his katana to cut off their restraints.\nMagna asks if they are going to stop the Believers, but Yami tells him that there is no hurry. Yami then notices that the Silver Eagles Captain, Nozel Silva, and the Crimson Lions Captain, Fuegoleon Vermillion, are flying in on their mercury eagle spell and Fire Spirit Salamander, respectively. Riding with Fuegoleon is Cob Portaport. Fuegoleon calls out to the Devil Believers and asks them to hear them out. Dazu considers his request to be ridiculous and calls out to everyone to send her their magic. The Believers and followers all raise their grimoires and send their magic to her. Nozel and Fuegoleon begin to despair the idea of reasoning with them.\nA titanic ice monster rises from behind the next mountain over, casting its shadow over everyone and unleashing a mighty roar. Nozel and Fuegoleon theorize that Dazu must have attracted the ice monster by gathering everyone's magic together, due to her Catalyst Magic having an effect on the surrounding mana in the Grand Magic Zone. The monster attacks the Believers by sending a wave of snow, but Magna stops the wave with his Exploding Fireball. There are still a few large rocks flying toward the Believers, but Noelle stops them with her Valkyrie Dress. Asta charges toward the Believers. Dazu moves to defend her satchel, thinking Asta is going for his grimoire, but he actually runs past her and headbutts a rock that Noelle missed. Secre uses her Closed Sorrow to heal the wounded followers. Dazu is surprised that the Magic Knights were trying to save them.\nThe ice monster shoots a beam from its mouth at Fuegoleon, but he blocks it with his Ignis Columna. Nozel uses his Silver Bullet and the monsters face, destroying its right eye and braking its right horn. While the monster is trying to grab Nozel, Yami uses Dark Cloaked Avidya Slash to destroy its right hand. Nozel uses Silver Shining Regal Spear to give Yami a foothold and slash off the monsters right arm. Fuegoleon uses Salamander's Breath to blast the monster in its torso and uses Dark Cloaked Black Blade to deal the finishing blow.\nThe Devil Believers and their followers are in awe at the power of the three Captains. After seeing them beat the ice monster so easily, the Believers and their followers knew that they did not have a chance. Dazu grabs a potion from her bag.\nThe Captains clarify that they just want to talk. Fuegoleon has Cob open a portal and out of it comes William Vangeance and Damnatio Kira. Yami sarcastically thanks William for coming and complains about him bringing Damnatio. William says that he is happy to help and that he still needs to atone. William tells Secre that he is glad she is safe.\nWilliam approaches the crowd and tells them that since they have not actually crossed the border, they are technically not guilty of any crimes. He tells them that the Magic Knights understand their plight and asks to be given time to help them. The Believers followers do not have faith in William's words, as the Magic Knights mostly consist of Nobles and Royals. Yami points out to them the Magic Knights are more of a mixed bag than they think, the Black Bulls especially.\nThe Captain's express their regret for not helping them sooner and promise to find a way to correct the imbalance in their society. William removes his mask and reveals his scar-like birthmark. He tells the people of his past and how he was treated terribly before he met Julius Novachrono. William promises to follow Julius's example and make the world a better place for them to live. This convinces all the people to turn around and return home.\nAfter the people have left, the Captain's address Dazu, Bow, and the rest of the Devil Believers. Since they had committed actual crimes of kidnapping, incitement of rioting, and the murder of the three Magic Parliament guards, they were another matter entirely from everyone else. Dazu tries to use the potion that she had grabbed earlier, but Yami stops her easily. Damnatio sentences the Devil Belivers to exile. He has Cob create a portal for them, but Dazu refuses to go through, tired of other people deciding her fate. Where they go next is up to them.\nDazu returns Asta's grimoire to him. He promises her that he will one day be the Magic Emperor and change the Clover Kingdom and asks her to watch no matter where she goes. Dazu says goodbye to him and expresses her wish that she could have been more like him.\nThe Believers apologize to Secre and ask her to pass the apology on to Marie Adlai as well. Dazu leans on Bow and admits that there is almost no chance of them making it through their current trial alive, but the Believers are resolute. The Believers discard their masks and warn the Magic Knights that if they fail to create change, more groups like the Devil Believers would continue to rise.\nThe Believers set out into the Neutral Zone and Damnatio goes back through Cob's portal, thinking of Kabwe Carillon and how the scales tipped toward darkness must be tipped back toward the light.\nAs the Believers begin their journey, Dazu thinks about the deaths of her husband and mother-in-law, and how she had been the one who killed them. She thinks about how awful they were to her. When their house collapsed during the elves attack, Meshu begged for Dazu to save them quickly, lest they die. As Dazu tried to lift the rubble, Vide called her a good-for-nothing wench. This made Dazu snap. Dazu never felt any regret for what she did to them and believes they got what they deserved. Even with them dead, the flames of hatred still burned inside of her. The Devil Believers are still determined to reach the Spade Kingdom at any cost and gain Devil power.\n", "Secre Swallowtail stands on top of the Black Bull base late in evening and reminisces about times long past, specially the day that Lemiel Silvamillion Clover was designing and making notes about a new magic tool that could store and redistribute mana. Secre brought him a cup of tea, but by the time he finished writing, it was already cold, much to Secre's annoyance. Lemiel showed Secre his design and she thought it was fascinating. Lemiel stated that he designed it specifically to help the small population within the Clover Kingdom who have almost no magic power, as it would allow them to use greater amounts of magic, similar to what the elves can do with the magic stones. Lemiel hoped that this invention would save those people from the discrimination they suffer, but there were other things that needed to be handled first.\nSecre then remembers Dazu Tayak and the Devil Believers, who committed their crimes because they suffered from the very discrimination that Lemiel was talking about back then. Secre realizes that even after 500 years, the Kingdom has not changed much at all.\nThe next morning, Secre, Asta, Noelle Silva, Finral Roulacase, and Yami Sukehiro meet with Julius Novachrono, who wants to ask them some questions regarding the Devil Believers. After hearing about Asta's conversation with Dazu, Julius understands why the Devil Believers were formed. Marx Francois enters the room and announces that they have received a message from Lolopechka. Marx establishes communication and Lolopechka begins to explain the reason why she called, but suddenly collapses, seemingly in terrible pain. Julius sends the Black Bulls to go check on Lolopechka, but has Secre stay behind to help him with another matter. Julius has Secre turn back to her human form and asks her to accompany him to the basement library, while Marx takes care of the paperwork to legalize the Black Bulls entry into the Heart Kingdom.\nIn the Heart Kingdom, after exiting Finral's portal, the Black Bulls find themselves right outside of Lolopechka's palace. Finral, who is exhausted after creating a portal over such a far distance, theorizes that Lolopechka is generating a barrier from her own immense amount of mana that prevented him from creating a portal inside the building. The Black Bulls are confronted by Gadjah, who accuses them of entering the country illegally. He prepares to punish them, but Yami tells him to wait a few minutes while the paperwork for their entry is finished. Gadjah agrees and receives a call telling him that paperwork has been submitted. Gadjah apologizes and escorts them to Lolopechka. She greets them and they are surprised by her casual attire. Finral begins to swoon over her beauty, but quickly berates himself. Lolopechka asks why they have come and they ask why she no longer seems to be in a state of suffering. Lolopechka trips and Undine helps her up. Lolopechka explains that the earlier pain she was suffering was actually a case of tummy trouble. Gadjah takes his leave and Yami has Finral create a portal home for him.\nNoelle expresses her relief that it was not Megicula's curse that was causing Lolopechka distress. Lolopechka begins to tell them what she was trying to say earlier before she collapsed, that the Spirit Guardians are ready to train with the Magic Knights from Clover, but then she realizes that her glasses are missing. Undine finds a pair, but they are broken, and she does not have any more pairs because she is always breaking them due to her clumsiness. Asta offers to help her find them, but Lolopechka believes she already knows where to find them.\nLolopechka uses the spell that allows her to oversee the entire Heart Kingdom, focusing on one area in particular. Undine spots the glasses in the possession of a beaver named Mugi, who tends to visit the palace every now and then. Noelle notices that Mugi bears a strong resemblance to Lolopechka's giant beaver rug and is surprised to learn that the rug is actually alive. Lolopechka introduces the rug as Mugi's mother, Big Mugi. The beavers like to stir up trouble and sometimes borrow Lolopechka's things without asking. Asta offers to track down Mugi and get her glasses back, saying it is the least they can do since the Heart Kingdom will be helping them train for the upcoming war with the Spade Kingdom.\nAfter reaching the river where the beavers live and finding their dam, Finral tries to use his Spatial Magic to teleport Mugi and the glasses to himself. Unfortunately, he grabs Mugi by the fur, which beavers do not like, and Mugi bites him and jumps back into the water with the glasses. Noelle tries to chase after Mugi underwater with her Valkyrie Dress, but she gets paralyzed by the beaver's cuteness.\nMugi laughs at them and Asta gets an idea. Asta goes fishing and collects a bucket full of the fish that Mugi likes to eat. Mugi sneaks up behind him to try and get the fish, but Asta is able to sense the beaver's ki approaching. Asta catches Mugi and offers to trade the fish for the glasses, which Mugi accepts. After seeing Asta's sensory technique, Lolopechka and Undine recognize it as the technique used in Hino Country, and the method that Asta used to locate Lolopechka back when they first met. Lolopechka believes that Asta will only continue to get stronger.\nThe Black Bulls return to the palace and give the glasses back to Lolopechka, but she immediately stumbles and drops them, causing them to break. Noelle questions if Lolopechka actually needs her glasses, as she seems to be able to see just fine in her royal regalia. Undine explains that while wearing her crown, Lolopechka uses Mana Zone to make up for her poor vision, though it would be impractical to do this all the time, as Lolopechka needs to keep some mana in reserve for when she really needs it. Gadjah then returns with a bulk shipment of new glasses for Lolopechka.\nLolopechka, after facing the wrong way and putting her new glasses on, explains that the reason it took so long for the Spirit Guardians to get ready for the joint training was because they needed to be at their very best. She also states that each Spirit Guardian can only train a limited number of mages. Asta gets excited, but Noelle reminds him that he might not be one of the trainees. Lolopechka confirms that Asta and Secre will be necessary due to both of them being Arcane Stage. Asta questions if Julius and Captain Yami would be included as well, but Lolopechka and Gadjah deny this as they are both already impossibly strong, and Yami has apparently already found a way to get stronger.\nBack in the Clover Kingdom, Julius informs Secre that he lost the key to a door and has Secre use her Sealing Magic to open it. Upon entering the room, they find Lemiel's old notebook, the same one where he wrote his designs for the tool that stores and distributes magic. Julius correctly assumes that the tool was never perfected due to the technology at the time being not good enough and plans to pass the book along to the Magic Tool Research Lab so that they can develop a way to help the weaker citizens, like the Devil Believers. This reminds Secre of Lemiel, which comforts her.\nAsta, Noelle, and Finral return to the Black Bull base and tell Secre that it will soon be time to train with the Spirit Guardians. That evening, Secre promises to become stronger so that she can protect the Kingdom that Lemiel loved.\n", "Late at night, Grey is lying face down in bed, thinking about how all of her fellow Black Bulls are improving their combat and social skill. She believes that she needs to change for the better as well. Even though she no longer constantly stays in her creepy, hulking form, she wants to feel more comfortable in her true form.\nThe next morning, Grey runs up to Noelle Silva and asks her to take her on as a student and help her learn to have the same poise and assertiveness that Noelle has as a royal. Noelle, flattered by Grey's praise, agrees to help. They head outside and Noelle has Grey undergo a few exercises to teach her to not get flustered when people look at her, but no matter what Noelle tries, Grey fails to not cover her face whenever Noelle looks at her.\nGordon Agrippa comes out from behind a tree and offers to help. He believes that being looked at by actual people is too much for Grey, so he has her practice with the lifeless stares of his creepy dolls. Noelle agrees that a baby step like this is a good idea. After assuring Grey that he and Noelle would not look, Gordon mimics the voices of the Black Bulls to make Grey's practice with the dolls more realistic. However, Grey is still extremely uncomfortable. She tries to be like Noelle, but transforms into Noelle on reflex, defeating the purpose of the exercise. After Grey changes back to normal, Noelle tells her to maintain the Noelle mentality in her true form. Grey gives it a try, but it does not work out. Gordon suggests that she try mimicking Asta instead. It goes well at first, but Grey is unable to keep it up for long. Noelle and Gordon concede that they have done all that they can.\nGrey goes back inside, transforms into Gauche Adlai and goes to speak with the real Gauche. When he asks why she is walking around as him, she replies that she would like to learn confidence from him. At first, Gauche refuses, but after Grey offers to do a favor for him in return, he agrees to help on the condition that Grey transforms into Marie Adlai and reads a script of cute quotes to him.\nGrey and Gauche go outside and Gauche surrounds her with a dome of mirrors, each one containing his reflection. Grey is terrified of so many pairs of eyes looking at her, but tries to power through it. She cannot handle it, though. A butterfly flies through the mirror dome and the reflections of the butterfly put Grey into a trance. Gauche commands her to have the carefree mentality of a turtle. He takes her into town and she seems to be handling being around so many people well. Gauche tells her to fulfill her end of the deal and transform into Marie and recite the lines he wrote for her. She does this, but gets scared back to her true form when Gauche tries to hug her. The hypnosis has also worn off.\nGauche tells her to just stay in her other form, but Grey does not want to because it would not be the real her. Gauche refuted this by telling her that she is still Grey, no matter what form she takes.\nAt the Blue Rose base, Charlotte Roselei is battling against her subordinates, defeating them with little to no effort. Sol Marron praises Charlotte for her skill, but Charlotte believes that she is still not strong enough for the upcoming war with the Spade Kingdom. Charlotte, seeing that her subordinates are all exhausted, decides it is time to take a break. The members of the Blue Rose Squad have a nice little picnic lunch and lament not getting much free time lately, but still have a strong resolve to get stronger for the upcoming war. Charlotte is happy that the members of her Squad are so enthusiastic and believes it is probably because she eased the restrictions on fraternizing with men.\nThe girls start talking about their boyfriends, making Charlotte and Sol uncomfortable. Puli Angel asks Charlotte if there has been any progress in her quest for romance with Yami Sukehiro. This embarrasses Charlotte and she demands the girls discuss something else. Charlotte had been planning to give Yami a gift and ask him to dinner, but she chickened out. Sol claims that Charlotte would never be reduced to being a man's arm candy and Charlotte states that the war with Spade should be everyone's focus right now. Puli insists that the upcoming war is exactly why they all need extra love in their lives. Puli believes that the war is the perfect opportunity for romance to bloom.\nCharlotte tells them to forget romance and that if they do not shape up, they will all die in the upcoming war. She declares the break over and demands that they get back to training. Charlotte has Sol, Puli, Selena, and Galgaria attack her all at once. Despite their efforts, Charlotte still beats them all easily.\nAfter training concluded, the Blue Rose Knights came up with a plan to get stronger while also getting Yami and Charlotte together. They propose to Charlotte that the Blue Roses have a joint training session with the Black Bulls. Charlotte agrees to see about making the arrangements. Marx Francois contacts Charlotte to confirm that she will be attending the next Captain's meeting, which she says she will.\nBy the time of the Captain's meeting, Charlotte tries asking Yami about the joint training session, but trips into Yami's arms, causing her to get flustered and run away.\nMarx informs Julius Novachrono that all the Captains, with the exception of Charlotte, have arrived for the meeting. Marx informs Julius that Charlotte mentioned her squad was hoping to train with the Black Bulls. This gives Julius an idea, to have all the Captains fight each other so as to restore the peoples faith in the Magic Knights and increase morale among the squads.\n", "Julius Novachrono wants to restore the people's faith in the Magic Knights and increase the morale among the squads, so he has eight of the captains compete in a crystal destruction match that will be broadcast across the Clover Kingdom. The first team is Jack the Ripper, Yami Sukehiro, Nozel Silva, and Kaiser Granvorka; the second team is Dorothy Unsworth, William Vangeance, Charlotte Roselei, and Fuegoleon Vermillion. Rill Boismortier is not participating because he is preoccupied with thoughts of the woman who saved him from Lira. Meanwhile, Owen sits in disguise as Julius next to King Augustus Kira Clover XIII as they watch the events from a platform near the battlefield.\nWilliam starts off the battle by summoning a world tree from the sky and firing wooden spears from it. Nozel and Kaiser block the spears, while Jack spins like a buzz saw and slashes off one of the roots. Yami attempts to slice the tree, but Charlotte wraps his wrist with briars, stopping him from drawing his sword. William shoots more spears at Yami, so Kaiser uses his Vortex Magic to breaks up the ground into large chunks, which Nozel grabs with Mercury Magic and lobs at Charlotte and William. Charlotte retreats with her team's crystal. When three large chunks come flying toward Charlotte, Dorothy appears in front of her and sends the chunks of earth to Glamour World. Jack, who was hiding behind the blocks, ambushes the two women; however, Fuegoleon's wall of fire forces Jack to retreat.\nAfter the flames die down, Jack and Yami chase after the other team into the forest. Nozel and Kaiser stay back to defend the crystal. Meanwhile, Fuegoleon drops down from Salamander. Nozel lures Fuegoleon out over the water and devises a plan with Kaiser.\nIn the forest, Yami and Jack grow impatient defending against Charlotte and William's guerilla attacks so they decide to decimate the surrounding trees. However, their large magic use allows William's Great Tree Mistilteinn to grow. As Yami and Jack race up the tree, Dorothy appears next to Yami and pulls him into the Glamour World, leaving Jack alone to face Charlotte and William.\nInside the dream world, Yami tries to trick Dorothy into creating things, like Sally did, but it does not work on Dorothy. She then creates a clone of Yami to attack him.\nOver the lake, Nozel traps Fuegoleon within a Silver Star of Execution that is reinforced by Kaiser's Vortex Magic. Fuegoleon raises the temperature of his Fire Magic and vaporizes the lake. In the distraction, Fuegoleon escapes the cage and punches Kaiser, who falls against the crystal and slightly cracks it. Jack is thrown over to his team, and a Mistilteinn Seed traps him in a tree before he can get up. Nozel flies away with the crystal until a fireball destroys part of his bird. After Nozel crashes, Kaiser manages to defend against William's attack. Hoping to free Jack, Nozel distracts William and strikes at the tree that formed around Jack. Fuegoleon prepares a giant fireball, but Jack breaks free and slashes through the fireball. Kaiser, Nozel, and Jack combine their magic into a giant tornado and fight against Salamander, which has grown larger by burning William's and Charlotte's magic.\nIn the dream world, Yami defeats the clone, so Dorothy creates several more. After blocking the clones' combined attacks, Yami slices through the Glamour World itself with his Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash: Equinox, while outside the dream world, the other captains' clashing Compound Magic creates a massive explosion.\nThe match ends in a draw since Yami's spell split both crystals. The captains meet in Julius's office, and he urges them to use the fight as motivation to improve themselves and their squads.\n", "For months, the Magic Knights have been training for the upcoming war with the Spade Kingdom and the devil Megicula. Asta and Noelle Silva are training especially hard after being inspired by the recent battle between the Captains. Finral Roulacase, along with Gordon Agrippa and Yami Sukehiro calls out to them, letting them know it is time to go to the annual Magic Knights Entrance Exam. Finral opens a portal to the Royal Capital and the five of them, along with Secre Swallowtail in her bird form, go through.\nThe town was as busy as ever, which is a good sign, as it means the town is mostly recovered from the attack. Asta thanks Yami for letting them come along, though Yami claims that he only let them come so Asta would stop pestering him about it. Asta wants to return to where his journey started on the one year anniversary of the day he became a Magic Knight.\nMagic Knight hopefuls are walking into the coliseum one by one, the locals wishing them luck. There are fewer applications than usual since some parts of the kingdom are still rebuilding.\nYami goes to join the other Captains and tells Asta and Noelle not to cause trouble. Asta notes that they were down in the arena just a year prior and Noelle notes that anyone in the crowd below could become the newest member of the Black Bulls. Noelle thinks it would be nice to have a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 wanting to be just like her. Asta is suddenly attacked by a flock of Anti-birds.\nNozel Silva comes across Noelle. She tells him that Asta though it might be helpful to revisit their roots before the upcoming war. Noelle remembers last years exam, when Nozel stopped her from participating because her placement had already been decided. Noelle now knows that her brother was trying to protect her. Noelle tells Nozel that she wondered why she was placed in the Black Bulls, but she now realizes that it is a perfect fit for her, and the squad mates she worked with have become like family. Nozel is proud of how much Noelle has grown and he knows she has the potential to grow even more.\nThe Captains arrive at their seats, scaring away the Anti-birds. William Vangeance steps forward and commends the applicants for wanting to become Magic Knights. William announces that even if they fail today's exam, their journey is not over, and they can retake the exam the next year, as many times as they desire. William uses his Magic Tree Descent to give the examinees magic broomsticks. William announces that the exam will now begin.\nAs the applicants are trying to fly on their broomsticks, Asta and Noelle remember last years exam, where Asta was completely unable to get off the ground or preform any of the tests. Noelle says she was sure Asta would fail. Noelles reminisces about how Yami took a liking to him and all the adventures and battles he had gone through since then. Asta tells Noelle that she is awesome for how much she has improved her control of her immense magic and developed a number of amazing new spells, such as her Valkyrie Dress.\nThey realize that they will probably have to face greater trials in the future and resolve to get stronger.\nYuno is watching the exam as well, much to Sylphs boredom. Asta runs up to Yuno and they get into one of their usual arguments. Asta and Yuno remember the promise they made when they were young, to one day become the Magic Emperor.\nAfter the exam has concluded, Asta and Noelle meet up with Finral, Gordon, and Captain Yami. Yami ended up not recruiting any new members. There was one applicant who interested him, but he was recruited by another squad. The Black Bulls return to their base for a party to celebrate the one year anniversary of Asta and Noelle joining the squad.\nJulius Novachrono is in the arena and Marx Francois finds him. Marx is annoyed that Julius continues to sneak out. Julius is happy that so many young mages want to become Magic Knights.\nAt the Golden Dawn base, William Vangeance returns Yuno's magic stone, which had been among the treasures Revchi Salik and Gueldre Poizot stole from the Shadow Palace.\n", "Marx Francois reports to Julius Novachrono that even the parts of the Forsaken Realm that were hit hardest by the elves' attack have begun to recover. Marx tells Julius that he has a meeting with the captains followed by a War Merits Conferment Ceremony. At the captains meeting, Marx informs everyone that the meeting is to determine who will participate in the training in the Heart Kingdom. Julius informs them that the five Spirit Guardians are ready to begin the training regimen. Julius asks each of the captains which subordinates they will be nominating to go, but reminds them that each Spirit Guardian can only take a limited number of students.\nYami Sukehiro nominates Asta and Secre Swallowtail from the Black Bull squad. Julius agrees that those two will be a tremendous asset in the upcoming war, due to both of them being Arcane Stage. Yami also nominates Luck Voltia, Finral Roulacase, and Noelle Silva. Nozel Silva seems worried about Noelle being a candidate, about which Dorothy Unsworth teases him. Julius agrees with Yami, since one of the Spirit Guardians uses Lightning Magic, Lolopechka uses Water Magic, and support mages should not be underestimated.\nWilliam Vangeance nominates Mimosa Vermillion from the Golden Dawn squad, believing that her Healing Magic will be invaluable. Julius asks if Yuno will also be nominated to train with the wind Spirit Guardian, but William says that Yuno already declined. Fuegoleon Vermillion nominates Leopold Vermillion for his great ambition that no one else in the Crimson Lion squad can match. Fuegoleon hopes that training in the Heart Kingdom will help Leopold to overcome his hesitation.\nCharlotte Roselei asks if it is alright for the captains to nominate themselves. She remembers how it felt to be possessed by an elf and wants to feel that great power again. Julius asks if any of the other captains would like to go. Most refuse, but Rill Boismortier desperately begs to go, believing that he might be able to get close to the mysterious woman who saved him.\nNozel, Kaiser Granvorka, and Jack the Ripper confirm that they will not be nominating anyone. Julius and the captains agree on the nominees who have been proposed and the meeting is adjourned. Yami tries to leave, but Kaiser reminds him that they still have the decoration ceremony. Yami questions why he has to be there and Marx answers that King Augustus Kira Clover XIII will be there.\nAt the decoration ceremony, Augustus is feeling prideful that all of the captains are present for him. Owen is worried that Augustus will figure out that he is not the real Julius. Sekke Bronzazza signals to Jack the Ripper, asking if he can return to the Green Mantis squad, but Jack does not understand him.\nMarx announces that this ceremony is to honor those who distinguished themselves in the battle. He claims that Julius is still unable to speak, so he will conduct the ceremony himself.\nSol Marron of the Blue Rose squad with twenty-one stars is promoted to the rank of Fifth Class Senior Magic Knight. Marx commends her for her wise judgment that allowed her to get the injured Magic Emperor to safety. Sol believes that she was not calm at all and is upset that Charlotte was saved by a man. Sol starts glaring at Yami, and Charlotte is worried that Sol might be in love with him like she is.\nMimosa with twenty-three stars is promoted to the rank of Second Class Intermediate Magic Knight. Marx commends her for her compassion, and Dorothy states that Mimosa is the reason why so many people understand the importance of healing mages. Leopold with eighteen stars is promoted to the rank of Fourth Class Senior Magic Knight. Marx commends him for his strength of character that allowed him to rally his squadmates in a crisis. Leopold tries to reject the promotion because he believes he is unworthy, but he changes his mind after some words of encouragement from Fuegoleon.\nYuno with an impressive seventy-seven stars is promoted to the rank of First Class Senior Magic Knight. Rill realizes that Yuno alone earned more stars than the entire Aqua Deer squad had the previous year. Marx commends Yuno for his great strength, having dealt fatal damage to the devil Zagred. Upset that such a high rank is being bestowed on a peasant, Augustus announces that another mage will be honored at the ceremony: Sekke, who accidentally saved the King's life. Augustus uses his authority to grant Sekke the rank of First Class Senior Magic Knight. Sekke feels hated by everyone in the room and promises to uphold the rank he has been given and protect the Clover Kingdom.\nThe King leaves with Sekke, and Marx announces that all other Magic Knights who fought to defend the kingdom will each be promoted by one rank, which is the real reason why all the captains were required to attend. Marx also notes that if not for the Magic Parliament trial causing chaos, there might have been many more promotions. Yami is given a medal for his actions. Marx announces the end of the ceremony and reads a message from Julius.\nYami and Finral teleport back to the Black Bulls base. Luck and Magna Swing are having one of their usual fights while Asta is working out. Yami announces who will be going to the Heart Kingdom. Magna begs to be allowed to go as well and Yami says he will see what he can do.\nAt the Golden Dawns base, Yuno is being watched by Vice-Captain Langris Vaude.\n", "At the Golden Dawns base, David Swallow and some other Magic Knights are talking about Yuno being promoted to First Class Senior Magic Knight and how he could soon end up usurping the position of vice-captain from Langris Vaude. They accidentally bump into Langris, who had overheard everything they were saying.\nLangris meets with Captain William Vangeance who asks Langris if it is time he got back to his duties. Langris says that he needs a little more time and leaves the room.\nLangris meets with Finesse Calmreich for tea and asks her if his brother has been in contact with her. Finesse shows him a stack of letters that she got from Finral. She admits that she finds it odd that he is using his Spatial Magic to send her letters when he could be using it to actually come visit. Langris theorizes that Finral is doing so as part of his training.\nIn the Black Bulls base, Finral sneezes. Noelle Silva asks if he is getting sick. He flirts with her out of habit and starts bashing his head against the floor to punish himself.\nBack with Finesse and Langris, he asks her about what was in the letters and she replies that Finral will be going to train in the Heart Kingdom. Finesse is worried about him needing to go to another land and asks if there is going to be another big battle. She tried to get Finral to tell her face to face after pulling him through one of his mail portals. Langris assures her that she does not need to worry. Finesse notes that Finral and Langris are very much alike. This angers Langris and he demands that she never compare them. Langris apologizes for his outburst. Finesse starts coughing and Langris asks if she is alright. She assumes him that it is just her usual cough. Langris says he has important business to attend to and Finesse asks if that means he has returned to his duties as vice-captain. Langris simply leaves and thanks her for the tea.\nIn the courtyard of the Golden Dawns base, many of the Magic Knights are relaxing and playing board games. Langris approaches Yuno, who is lying on the grass, and challenges him to a duel. Yuno does not hesitate to accept. Alecdora Sandler informs William of the fight.\nIn the field outside of the Golden Dawn's base, Yuno and Langris stand opposite of each other. Langris proposes a wager that whomever loses must resign from the Golden Dawn, surprising the other Golden Dawn members who came to watch the fight.\nBack during the aftermath of the Diamond Kingdom's attack on Kiten, Langris told Yuno that his friends were an embarrassment, but Yuno blatantly denied that, saying that Asta is his rival in the race to become Magic Emperor. Yuno declared that before becoming Magic Emperor, he would become Captain of the Golden Dawn.\nIn the present, Langris reminds Yuno of what he said back then and points out that if he wins, then the current vice-captain would resign, putting Yuno one step closer to the top. Yuno tells Langris to stop talking and start fighting. The other Golden Dawn members note that things are elevating. Alecdora wants to stop the fight, but William decides to allow them to proceed.\nLangris throws a large Spatial Magic attack at Yuno, but Yuno tilts his head to the side, dodging the attack and causing it to hit the rock behind him. Langris continues to attack and Yuno counters with his Wind Blades Shower. Langris teleports the wind blades out of existence, but one manages to get through and cut his squad robe. Langris admits that he was being careless. Yuno accuses Langris of holding back and asks him to start fighting for real. Langris summons his Archangel Shootdown and Yuno activates Spirit Dive. Langris sends his barrage at Yuno, but Yuno dodges them using Spirit's Hushed Dance. Yuno attacks with Spirit Storm, but his attack is stopped by the automatic defense spell that Ratri used while possessing Langris's body, a spell that Langris should no longer be able to use. Langris can still feel faint traces of elven magic still inside him.\nLangris sends more spatial orbs at Yuno. As Yuno is flying to get away from them, he tries to attack Langris, but his attacks are stopped by the spatial barrier. Langris appears to actually hit Yuno with his Archangel Shootdown, but it turns out to have just been an afterimage. The real Yuno appears behind Langris with his Spirit of Zephyr to Langris's neck, winning the fight.\nLangris tells Yuno to go ahead and laugh, having been beaten despite giving his all. Yuno notes that Langris did not get serious until halfway through the fight, and before that point was trying to lose. Langris admits that Yuno is correct, he had hoped that he could resign with some dignity. Langris accuses himself of being shamed after losing while fighting for real, but Yuno declares that Langris is not in shame, as it was a very difficult fight. Langris does not care about the difficulty Yuno dealt with and says that only the victory itself is important. Langris states that he will leave the Golden Dawn as promised, but Yuno points out that he never actually agreed to that wager. Langris still intends to leave and tells Yuno to take good care of the squad. Yuno calls out to Langris and tells him that if he had gone all out from the beginning, then he might have won. Yuno asks Langris to fight him again some day.\nLangris apologizes to William for not consulting him. William states that Langris did not need to resort to some big performance in order to resign. William assures him that this is not the end of his journey and that he is still part of the Golden Dawn.\nLangris, clad in a cloak, visits Finesse. She asks about his outfit and he tells her that he is going on a journey. Finral pokes his head through a portal and says hello to Finesse. Finral asks his brother about the cloak and Langris mockingly guesses that Finral wanted to pay a visit to Finesse before heading to the Heart Kingdom. Finral admits that Langris is correct. Langris says he still has not decided to let Finral win the love of Finesse. Langris leaves on his journey. \nAt the Black Bulls Base, Charmy Pappitson is making a meal for those going to the Heart Kingdom, since they will need to keep their strength up. Gordon Agrippa expects that he will also be invited to the Heart Kingdom, even though he already has plans to train his Curse Magic with his father; however, his squadmates do not even notice he is there. Magna Swing asks if he can go, and Yami Sukehiro confirms that he can. Yami tells his subordinates that they will be going to the Heart Kingdom tomorrow. Noelle resolves to get stronger and defeat Megicula.\n", "The time has come for the Clover Kingdom Magic Knights to train with the Spirit Guardians in the Heart Kingdom. The members of the Black Bull squad who will be participating are outside their base, talking about how much stronger they will get and remembering the promises they have made. Finral Roulacase opens a portal and the Black Bulls travel through it to the Heart Kingdom Royal Palace. Once there, they see that the other Magic Knights who will be participating in the Heart Kingdom training; Leopold Vermillion, Mimosa Vermillion, Captain Charlotte Roselei, and Captain Rill Boismortier, have already arrived.\nGadjah meets the Clover Kingdom mages and invites them inside. Once in the throne room, Lolopechka welcomes them and apologizes for the lack of celebration that would normally be held in honor of their visit. The Magic Knights are surprised to see Charmy Pappitson lying on Lolopechka's lap. Charmy replies that she came to the Heart Kingdom to try the delicious food.\nLolopechka asks Gadjah to explain the training that they came for. Gadjah begins by explaining that the Spade Kingdom has already conquered most of the Diamond Kingdom and it would not be very long before Spade starts to focus on the Heart and Clover Kingdoms. Gadjah introduces the Spirit Guardians who would be training them, who appear on magical screens. The Spirit Guardian of Earth - Sarado, The Spirit Guardian of Plants - Potrof, The Spirit Guardian of Fire - Floga, and The Spirit Guardian of Wind - Smurik.\nGadjah says that Mimosa and Captain Charlotte would be training with Sarado, Finral would be training with Smurik, Rill would train with Potrof, and the rest would be paired up based on their Magic Attributes; the Fire mages would work with Floga and Luck Voltia would train with Gadjah himself. Asta asks about himself, but Gadjah states that it would be pointless, since Asta has no magic. Asta questions why he even had to come and Gadjah explains that Asta is an Arcane stage Mage, and therefore vital. Gadjah requests a battle with Asta to get a feel for his strength. Lolopechka states that she and Undine will oversee the training of Secre Swallowtail and Noelle Silva themselves. Magna Swing requests that he be allowed to train under Gadjah instead of Floga, so as to keep his rivalry with Luck. Gadjah agrees to this. Gadjah also informs them that once they show improvement, they will rotate to other Spirit Guardians so as to learn even more and keep their skill set well rounded.\nAsta explains that Luck and Magna both have natural element Attributes, which makes them both well suited for the Heart Kingdom technique. Gadjah shows them how to shape natural mana into mana words, and explains that these mana words allow one to add simple commands for their spells to follow. Gadjah demonstrates by having Asta dodge a lightning ball which continues to chase after him afterwards.\nIn the middle of a field, Sarado explains to Charlotte and Mimosa that plants grow from the earth, and that to strengthen their plant based magic they should begin with the soil. Sarado decides to give them a demonstration by raising some earth pillars that stop just short of hitting the Clover mages before disappearing. Sarado explains that regardless of a mages Attribute, you have to be in tune with nature. Charlotte and Mimosa question how it works. Sarado tries to explain by describing the feelings she feels when it happens, but this only confuses her new pupils.\nIn the mountains, Smurik explains to Finral that all the winds from around the Kingdom pass through the valley in front of them. Smurik admits he was hoping to train the one who had been chosen by the wind spirit, but got Finral instead. Smurik creates wind swords all around Finral and says that it is his move. Finral opens a portal to escape, but finds more wind swords beyond the exit portal. Smurik states that Finral believes Spatial Magic is for support and that he needs to develop skills in direct combat.\nIn a mild volcanic region, Floga notes that it is a nice day for training and Leopold is eager to get started. Floga asks for a demonstration of Leopolds Magic at 80%. After seeing what Leopold can do, Floga is impressed and notes that Leopold has great potential. Leopold believes that it is not good enough. Leopold asks to see Floga's magic. Floga creates a massive upward flame blast. Leopold apologizes for doubting Floga. Floga states the Leopold has greater potential than his own and he will get much stronger once he learns to use natural mana.\nBack in the palace, Magna is struggling with making mana words. Gadjah explains that Magna, a fifth stage mage, did not have strong enough mana and that a mage needs to be at least third stage before they can use the technique in combat. Meanwhile, Luck was making mana words easily, much to Magna's frustration. Asta wants to go after Magna, but Luck says to let him go. Gadjah apologizes for the wait and asks to begin the fight with Asta.\nIn the forest, Potrof says that he will begin by teaching Rill how to bask in natural mana. Potrof states that the forest is full of life, which means it is also rich with mana. Rill states that begins to feel the natural mana now that Potrof has pointed it out. Potrof begins to explain the Heart Kingdoms technique of using natural mana and demonstrates by growing a bunch of trees. Rill notes that he is feeling inspired by Potrof's Magic and Potrof tells him to go with it, but instead making mana words, Rill just paints the scenery. Potrof tells Rill to try directly writing the mana words with his paint, which seems to work. Rill continues to paint, making his artwork even more amazing, much to Potrof's frustration.\nCharmy shows up in the forest on the hunt for anything edible after having eaten all the food in the palace. Potrof offer to teach her the Heart Kingdom technique as well. Charmy is not interested at first, but then uses mana words to find food. Potrof tries to explain more, but Charmy and Rill are only interested in finding more food and other artistic inspiration, respectively.\nIn the Palace, Lolopechka explains to Noelle and Secre that she needs them to rescue her from Megiculas curse. Lolopechka states that they will be the ones who defeat Megicula and tells them about Megicula's host, Vanica Zogratis. Undine explains that she and Lolopechka were no match for Vanica, and because of her weakness, Lolopechka was cursed. Lolopechka insists that it is not Undine's fault and that a devil host cannot be beaten by normal means. Lolopechka believes that she and Undine alongside Noelle and Secre create the best possible chance to take down Vanica and Megicula. The two girls begin training by fighting Lolopechka's water Knights.\nIn the mountains, Finral is getting better at using his portals to send attacks back at his opponent, but Smurik notes that he needs to better read his opponents attacks. In the field, Charlotte and Mimosa try fighting Sarado, but they keep getting overwhelmed by her earth attacks. In the volcanic region, Leopold is learning how to amplify his flames. In the forest, Gadjah is fighting against Black Asta, but the boy is unable to land a hit. Gadjah states that the power to nullify magic is unbeatable, but Asta is too narrow minded to use it to its full potential. Gadjah tries to give Asta advice, but Asta only continues to try powering through.\nIn a volcanic area of the Clover Kingdom, Yami Sukehiro listens to a report from from Finral, who states that their training is going very well, even though it is only the first day. Yami decides to up his own game as well.\n", "In the Heart Kingdom, Asta continues his training with Gadjah. In the Clover Kingdom, Yami Sukehiro seeks out Mereoleona Vermillion's help in learning to use Mana Zone. Both Black Bulls develop new skills after being pushed to their limits by their opponents. Afterward, the five Spirit Guardians meet with Lolopechka and report on the progress of the Magic Knights under their tutelage.\nMeanwhile, in the Spade Kingdom, the Resistance spies on the invasion force that the Dark Triad are building. When they are confronted by Spade Kingdom soldiers, the Resistance members run and send one of their members, Ralph Niaflem, to enter the nearby Grand Magic Zone and cross the neutral zone.\nLater on, one of the Spade Kingdom soldiers reports to Dante Zogratis that Ralph went to the Grand Magic Zone, but Dante says it does not matter as one person cannot ruin the Dark Triad's plan. As the soldier leaves the room, Dante casts an evil shadow on a wall.\n", "Before a rematch with Gadjah, Asta retells his history with the five-leaf clover grimoire, Anti Magic, and the swords, as well as learning to sense ki. Meanwhile, Noelle Silva continues her training with Lolopechka and Undine. After Noelle defeats several armored knights made of water, Lolopechka compliments her and shows her the training progress of the other Magic Knights.\nIn the Clover Kingdom, Magna Swing is discussing something with Zora Ideale. Vanessa Enoteca and Grey are watching Gauche Adlai walk away. Gordon Agrippa is continuing his studies under his father.\nDuring Asta and Gadjah's rematch, Asta is disarmed but learns to summon the Demon-Slayer Sword back to his hand.\n", "A hooded man struggles to cross a Grand Magic Zone and is determined not to die until he can deliver his message. In another part of the Grand Magic Zone, one of the Spade Kingdom's mobile fortresses moves through the area by drawing out mana from imprisoned citizens. One of the soldiers comments that Candelo is useful but requires a large amount of mana to make it functional. The captain informs him that they should use only half of them to cross the Grand Magic Zone even if it depletes their life energy indiscriminately.\nFrom a nearby pool of water, a clone of Undine espies Candelo and shares her vision with Lolopechka in the Heart Kingdom. Lolopechka thanks the Magic Knights who have assembled in the palace on short notice and informs them about the enemies' whereabouts. Gadjah announces that the Spade Kingdom has already taken over Diamond Kingdom in the last six months and has now begun to advance towards the Heart and Clover Kingdoms. The Magic Knights strategize about their counterattack, and Lolopechka worriedly informs them about how the enemies are mistreating their own people. Hearing this, Asta suddenly takes off from the meeting, and as the others worry about what to do next, Lolopechka smiles and says that it is better for him to go attack now. Gadjah is amazed at Asta's development and how he has become stronger than the others, despite their training methods being for those who are loved by mana.\nIn the Candelo, the Spade soldiers order the next set of prisoners to enter the magic-draining chamber. A woman begs them to leave her little sister since she is a child and has very little mana. A soldier admonishes her for talking against him and for being weak. He tears the woman's clothes and grabs her, but the Demon-Slayer Sword crashes through the window and barely misses the soldier. Landing in the fortress, Asta calls the Demon-Slayer Sword back to his hand and analyzes the situation. The soldier recognizes that Asta is a Magic Knight from the Clover Kingdom and mocks him for lacking mana while forming a huge suit of armor. The soldier boasts that he can defeat Asta in an instant. To his surprise, Asta cuts through the armor and knocks him out in one blow. Asta then challenges the other soldiers and defeats them quickly.\nAsta introduces himself to the prisoners and reassures them that he will not harm them. The woman cries out about their situation and feels hopeless since they cannot escape either the Grand Magic Zone or the captain possessing inhuman magic. Sensing that the people are frightened, Asta claims that he will defeat all the soldiers, but is suddenly interrupted as the enemies drop down and start attacking. Asta quickly draws out his Demon-Dweller Sword and slashes the enemies using Black Slash. Sensing the captain's ki up above, Asta charges through the ceiling and defeats the other soldiers present, while making his way towards their captain. Asta cuts open into the captain's room, and the captain senses that Asta shares the power of a devil. Asta questions the captain on mistreating his own people, to which the captain replies that they were mere sacrifices for the prosperity of Spade Kingdom. Asta is suddenly paralyzed as poison starts spreading through his body. The captain reveals that Asta cannot escape from his high-level Poison Magic, Basilisk's Breath, and claims him to be even useless as fodder to the Candelo. Asta uses the Demon-Destroyer Sword to erase the poison, which astonishes the captain. Asta enters his black form and compares their level of devil power. Asta adds that he will crush them all for sacrificing their own people, and uses Black Divider to cut through the captain's spell and the upper portion of the fortress while the image of the Anti Magic Devil looms above it. Meanwhile, Noelle flies towards the Candelo while carrying Mimosa Vermillion and Finral Roulacase.\nAsta drags the knocked out captain down to where the prisoners are and informs them that he has defeated everyone so they can relax now. Noelle reaches the Candelo and releases her spells, dousing Asta and Finral in water. Noelle complains on how hard it was on her to maintain a transport spell in Grand Magic Zone and inquires Asta on leaving them behind. Noticing the woman who was assaulted by the Spade soldier, Finral tries to flirt with her but backs off as he remembers that Finesse Calmreich is the only one for him. Mimosa's Princess-Healing Flower Paradise recovers the people's stamina. Noelle notices that the people are still sad, since they have lost their home to the soldiers. The woman replies that the soldiers were cruel enough to kill the people who resisted and they will be killed immediately even if they return. Noelle smiles and asks them not to worry as Leopold Vermillion and Luck Voltia have headed to the town to defeat the spade soldiers. During the earlier meeting, Lolopechka divided the forces to back up Asta and to liberate the occupied town.\nIn the town's fort, Luck and Leopold defeat every soldier using their new skills. Luck pulls out a Communication Magic tool and informs Asta that they have finished their work. Hearing it, Finral marks the current location and heads to the town. Observing their progress, Lolopechka is happy that it ended well but realizes that the real battle is yet to begin. The woman inquires what they are going to do to the town since they need to obey the strong in order to live. Asta smilingly replies that it is their town and that the Magic Knights will not be doing anything, and informs them that Finral will teleport them all back, which delights the prisoners. Asta says that their role is to defeat the devil in the Spade Kingdom. The woman reveals that the Spade Kingdom is currently being ruled by mages known as the Dark Triad and how their strength is almost like that of a devil.\nIn the Spade Kingdom castle, the Dark Triad meet with each other. Dante Zogratis asks Zenon if he has grown accustomed to the power of the devil yet. Zenon says that he mostly has, and adds that the fortress which they have sent to Heart Kingdom and base near the border has fallen. Dante pays no attention to it and claims it to be mere work so their soldiers will not get bored. Vanica complains that Zenon went to the Diamond Kingdom all by himself and that she wants to do something big too. Zenon states that he was more suited for the mission but Vanica replies that Zenon used only 40% of his devil power, which even she can do. Dante compliments Vanica for growing up and informs them that it is about time that they made their move. Vanica is excited to finally consume the delicious treat that she has been saving up. Zenon asks why they waited half a year. Dante tells them that everything was to prepare them for the moment that shall be upon them, and that it would be no fun if the game is over so soon. Dante adds that they are going to destroy everything in the world and that the necessary keys are within their reach. Zenon infers Dante's sentence as the two Arcane Stage mages. Dante tells them that they cannot escape and everything is in the palm of their hands.\nIn Hage, Sister Lily steps out of the church and discovers the hooded man lying on the ground, and he mutters Yuno's name.\n", "In Hage, Sister Lily and Father Orsi tend to the injured man, who lays unconcsious in a bed.\nIn the Royal Palace of the Heart Kingdom, Lolopechka thanks everyone for successfully completing their mission and guarantees the safety of Tolon, the town which they liberated. Lolopechka adds that as they gain more Spade Kingdom territory, the will corner the devils. Although it is a difficult task, Noelle Silva feels hopeful since they have Lolopechka's support. The Magic Knights discuss what to do next. Asta, Luck Voltia, and Leopold Vermillion wish to spar with Gadjah. Lolopechka wants to join the training but trips and falls. Noelle suggests they have a bath since they returned from a long travel to a Grand Magic Zone.\nLolopechka, Noelle, Mimosa Vermillion, and Secre Swallowtail decide to go for a bath but a villager rushes in for help, stating that Charmy Pappitson has appeared in the Polnfrume Forest. Finral Roulacase steps in to take care of the situation, but Asta convinces him that he can take care of it. Asta summons the Demon-Slayer Sword and flies off from the castle, while Finral reflects on how much Asta has improved. At Elmora Lake, the women bathe, discuss dating, and also speak on how fortunate they are to have met each other. Elsewhere, Luck and Leopold start sparring with Gadjah.\nAsta finds a fat Charmy and tries to dissuade her from eating more. Charmy refuses and uses her Cotton Magic and Mana Method to form a giant sheep. Back in the Golden Dawn base, a Magic Knight addresses Yuno as vice-captain and asks his permission to deliver a message from Hage. Hearing this, Yuno gets more eager.\nIn the Polnfrume Forest, Charmy causes more trouble as she gathers all the food from the forest. Potrof feels that he has created a monster and that it is his duty to stop Charmy. However, his Evergreen Vida Valtoria spell merely passes through the giant sheep and cannot stop it. Potrof and Asta team up to go against Charmy, but they fail again and Asta gets stuck in the cotton. Rill Boismortier arrives and freezes the sheep, allowing for Asta and Rill to shatter the cotton. Rill advises Charmy to avoid overeating, and then paints the goddess who saved him while he was possessed by Lira. Asta explains to Rill that it was Charmy who saved him, but Rill refuses to believe it.\nYuno flies to Hage and is welcomed by Sister Lily. Ralph recognizes Yuno's resemblance to Lady Ciel and the magic stone that Yuno wears. Sister Lily introduces Ralph to be from the Spade Kingdom. Yuno gets cautious but Ralph sooner convinces that he is not their enemy and tells them about the peaceful past under House Grinberryall's rule before the Dark Triad overtook their kingdom. Ralph states that Yuno is their only hope since he is the heir of House Ginberryall and the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.\n", "In the Golden Dawn base, the Magic Knights comment about Yuno's performance and popularity. Back in Hage, Father Orsi and Sylph are astonished as Yuno being the Prince of the Spade Kingdom. Ralph Niaflem questions about the creature to which the Sylph introduces herself as the Wind Spirit. Father Orsi inquires about Asta, as he was left beside Yuno when he found them, but Ralph replies that he has no idea about Asta. Yuno starts questioning Ralph but afraid Yuno will not believe him, Ralph introduces himself first and uses Trace Mirage on Yuno to have a look at his past.\nIn the past, people of Spade Kingdom celebrated the birth of its new prince as a new ray of light. King Loyce named the baby as Yuno and gifted him a magic stone from his last expedition. People from the Spade Kingdom adored Yuno, while Ralph's father advised Ralph that it is their duty to maintain peace in the Kingdom. Loyce appreciated the Zogratis siblings for completing their mission, but Ralph's father felt ominous about them and asked Ralph to keep an eye on them. Ralph wondered about his father's words but sooner regretted it as the Zogratis siblings committed treason. Zenon and Vanica Zogratis disposed of the soldiers, while Dante Zogratis overtook the throne from House Grinberryall and noticed Yuno to be missing.\nRalph's father escaped with baby Yuno while Ralph bought him some time. Ralph's father struggled with wounds to get across the Grand Magic Zone while the Dark Triad soldiers followed him by the order of Zenon. With the last bit of his mana, Ralph's father delivered Yuno in front of a church and died along with his pursuers, entrusting the future to Ralph. Yuno exits the vision and Ralph tries to convince Yuno that what he has shown is the truth. David Swallow contacts Yuno and tells him that the Golden Dawn base is under attack. \nAt the Golden Dawn's base, Zenon is attacking with the Dark Disciples Gaderois Godroc and Foyal Migusteau. The Disciples ask if they can go berserk, and Zenon tells them that they can kill all they want but to leave the Arcane Stage mage alive. Yuno flies off from Hage while Ralph warns him that a member from Dark Triad could be there. Back at Golden Dawn base, the Magic Knights notice the attackers are from the Spade Kingdom and attack them in unison. The Dark Disciples are found to be unharmed and Zenon seems to be missing. Gaderois mocks their inability to harm them and adds that it is not all the Golden Dawns' fault since the Dark Disciples are all hand picked elite that are compatible with the power they got from the Dark Triad and that they are all Stage Zero mages. Foyal uses his Mist Magic and disappears, Siren Tium charges at Gaderois but is overpowered by the latter. Gaderois defeats the other Magic Knights in a single sweep while commenting that the devil power can boost their magic to different level. Gaderois adds that the army captain can use around 5% and he can unleash 40% of the devil's power whereas Zenon can use around 80% of the devil's power.\nZenon finds William Vangeance and says he has been looking him for a while. William notices the bizarre magic power possessed by Zenon. Alecdora Sandler steps in to fight Zenon, determined by his duty and attacks using Sand-Armored Dreadnought Guard. Zenon uses Bone Magic to break the spell and to pierce Alecdora, but William's Magic Warding Ash saves Alecdora from further injury. William warns Zenon that he will not allow him to harm the Golden Dawn Magic Knights. Zenon comments about how he will take William's World Tree Magic for the benefit of the Spade Kingdom, while using his Eternal Fangs to attack. Yuno arrives outside the base and is shocked by the sight of the destroyed base and wounded Magic Knights. As Gaderois welcomes him, Yuno enters Spirit Dive and angrily demands to know what Gaderois has done to his comrades.\n", "Yuno Grinberryall recollects his memories with the Golden Dawn squad and how considerate and friendly they had become. In the present, Gaderois Godroc tells Yuno that he has killed half of his comrades and left others barely alive. Gaderois also adds that they should be honored of being beaten by someone strong like him. Yuno uses Spirit Storm but Gaderois blocks and destroys the spell. Gaderois feels excited to face a Spirit Magic user, but also warns Yuno that his Stone Magic has been enhanced with devil power and counterattacks Yuno. Using Spirit's Hushed Dance, Yuno evades Gaderois attacks and also saves his injured comrades. Gaderois feels lucky to meet a Stage Zero mage other than the Magic Knights Captain. Gaderois introduces himself and asks for Yuno's name, but Yuno refuses to give his name and attacks with Crescent Kamaitachi. \nAs the fight progress, Yuno asks Gaderois for his reason to fight, to which Gaderois replies that the Dark Triad has come here for the Stage Zero mage but he has just come to use his magic. Gaderois praises the strength of the Dark Triad and also criticizes the former Spade King. Upset by these remarks, Yuno asks what Gaderois feels when he kills people. Gaderois responds with a devilish smile that the destruction and fights he is involved with are all thrilling and exciting to him, and accuses Yuno of being the same as he is also strong. Enraged, Yuno attacks Gaderois with Spirit of Zephyr. Though Gaderois is able to block the spell, the wind accelerates and erodes his stone armor, enabling Yuno to cut through his stone armor. Yuno declares to himself that regardless of his status as a Magic Knight of the Clover Kingdom or a Prince of the Spade Kingdom, he will stop the people who have warped the world and break the chain of curses.\nIn the courtyard of the Golden Dawn base, Klaus Lunettes and two others Magic Knights are surrounded by mist. Klaus feels unsure about the enemy's location. Foyal Migusteau appears in front of him and compliments his magic. Klaus uses Blazing Spiral Lance to attack Foyal but it was a mist clone. Foyal bombards the Knights with condensed water bullets and defeats them while boasting about him being a Stage Zero Mage. In another part of the courtyard, Letoile Becquerel takes shelter in her Another Atlas spell, and thinks about how she has to do something or they will all be annihilated. Letoile feels useless as she is unable to locate the enemy's real body, and also remembers William Vangeance saying that they should use the remnant elves' power to protect their kingdom. Foyal asks the battered Klaus to surrender, Klaus rises back up and refuses to give up until his will has been broken. Foyal decides to finish off Klaus but suddenly his mists are  blown away by Yuno's Wind Magic. Foyal finds Yuno to be his natural enemy and restrains him with Sealing Spectral Hands before he can attack again. Using the opportunity, Letoile encloses the real Foyal in Another Atlas, and Klaus delivers the final blow. Klaus, Leotile and Yuno have a short reunion, but it is interrupted as the ceiling crashes from Zenon Zogratis and William's fight.\nAs the three of them see that the captain has been defeated, Klaus wonders just who or what Zenon is. Yuno remembers Zenon's face from the memories that Ralph Niaflem showed him. Zenon notes that Gaderois and Foyal failed and that there is no point in bringing along anyone who is not over 50%. Terrified by Zenon, Sylph tells Yuno to activate his Spirit Dive spell. Zenon attacks with Eternal Fangs, which overpowers Klaus and Leotile but Yuno cuts through the bones. Yuno looks back to find his comrades skewered. Enraged by the sight, Yuno charges at Zenon but his Spirit of Zephyr cannot cut through the bones due to Zenon's incredible regeneration. Noticing that Yuno is a Stage Zero mage, Zenon reveals 55% of his devil's power showing the devil behind him. Zenon comments that Yuno is not weak but he is just far stronger and destroys his Spirit of Zephyr with his bone sword. Zenon defeats Yuno while saying it is for the benefit of the Spade Kingdom.\nLater, Ralph manages to reach the Golden Dawn base and notices that the building has been destroyed. He enters and sees Yuno's grimoire laying on the ground. Ralph is shocked to see Sylph crying and a sword piercing Yuno's abdomen. Ralph reaches out to Yuno and the Sylph starts to fade. Both of them refuse to let Yuno die. Suddenly a surge of mana appears and a tree starts to grow, much to Ralph's confusion. Sylph realizes that this is William's World Tree Magic. The Budding of Yggdrasil spell heals all who are wounded, and as the Knights wake up, they note how William helped despite being badly wounded. As the Knights check around, they discover that only the people on verge of death were saved and that half the Golden Dawn are dead. Yuno thinks about how if only he was stronger and yells out.\n"]
